### Goals 

- To develop a Phrase-Based Neural Machine-Translation System, and 
- Test the system on choice of Indian languages as target languages given source as English 



### Problem 

*Machine Translation* (MT) is the task of automatically converting one natural language into another, preserving the meaning of the input text, and producing fluent text in the output language. In this project, we aim to develop a machine translation system using the novel architecture proposed in [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf) paper for the specific purpose of converting English text to multiple Indian languages as a starter.



### Expected Outcomes 

A Phrase-Based Neural Machine Translation System able to translate English text to different types of Indian languages such as Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, etc. 



### Milestones 

- Collect language datasets for English and various Indian languages such as Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, etc.
- Develop a Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation model taking English - Hindi as the first language pair.
- Train and Validate the system to fix its hyperparameters.
- Test the system on various language datasets both manually and automatically.
