Who is that?
That child! We won 't have any fruit left
Auntie
The orchard is private property, bought and paid for It will have to be fenced in if we 're to save any fruit
There are so many thieves about That wretched girl of Hori 's She' s always taking our fruit
She 'll take no notice of me, she' s not my daughter It doesn 't matter what we say; it' s up to her mother The mother will be shocked when she 's shamed before the village
- It 's too heavy for you - I can manage
Did I forget you, Durga? Wait
Come here She 's doing no harm; let her stay Why should she watch you eat?
Did you take something from Mrs. Mukherji 's garden?
What are you hiding?
Take them back to her Then come back and sweep the yard
You 're spoiling Durga - I don' t understand - You do You eat the fruit
The fruit Durga brings you
You should know better, shouldn 't you?
You think you can do as you please, living with us - I know you - What do you mean? You know.
I 've stood it for eight years; my patience is exhausted You spoil my daughter and I get the blame for it
It 's too much in my old age
Where are you going?
Auntie
Leave her alone, Durga
Did you hear me?
What else did I tell you to do?
- Where have you been, Auntie Indir? - I was staying with Raghu Then this morning I heard that Hori has...
Let me see his face properly
What a little darling
What are you cooking?
Pilau, korma... fine dishes One day you shall cook them, or have you forgotten how? I 've forgotten
Lucky January: The boy was born and you got a job That 's why I think we should spend a little...... and celebrate his birth in style
- Will you be paid regularly? - Why not? Ray is a good man
What do you mean? What about our garden? They said my brother owed them money when he was alive
The travelling players need new material Most writers are merely rehashing old stories If their stuff is popular...... shouldn 't my stuff be even more popular?
And you will teach the boy
It 's not long to the festival A good match will be found for Durga
We 'll have two good meals a day and new clothes twice a year That' s how it will be; my ancestors were writers, after all I keep alive the family tradition
Wake up, Apu; it 's time to go to school
Durga, wake Apu I can 't make him stir
There 's not much milk; do you feed the cow properly?
How many more times must you moisten your duster?
Sit down!
- What do you want? - Puffed rice, please Hand over the money, then
You 've netted a fine catch How many pupils now? The new boy makes nine
Go on like that and you 'll end up behind a plough
- You were saying, sir? - Have you seen any good plays? I did see one company
The next village has booked a very good company I 'll thrash you They thought they' d be one up on us, but they reckoned without me
I 've not put you down for a contribution...... but I' m sure you won 't forget my needs
Don 't forget your friend Boidyonath
Wait, Mr. Chakrabarti
The drummer...... of the company...... sounds like thunder
Sude, come here and bring your slate with you Bring me his slate
So this is what you 've been up to
Hold out your hand
What are you doing?
- What are you doing in the kitchen? - Nothing Nothing?
Why didn 't you ask?
Durga, come and help me when you are free
Girls of your age should help about the house, cooking, washing up...... performing religious rites Is it right to skylark about all day?
You must learn to cook, mustn 't you?
Are you feverish again today?
Remember to drink your herbal tincture
- I 'm hungry - Haven' t you had your puffed rice?
There is rice for you in the bowl ask Durga to give you some.
Help me up
My back is stiff - How are you these days? - Who cares about an old woman?
Just look at this
- It 's my shawl for the evenings - I' ll buy you a new one soon
Can I have a light?
We can 't afford so much tobacco
Did you ask for your pay today? Landlord Ray has his own troubles. I might risk my job if I ask now
Durga has not been well; she needs medicine and better food Apu needs new clothes; he 's going to school in rags
The house needs repairing, debts must be repaid We owe Mrs. Mukherji five rupees; she 'll press for repayment
You must do something
You won 't tell mother?
She 'll hear you
The sweet - seller
Halva, fudge, coconut cakes Ask father for money
You ask
Is he asking for money? Don 't pander to him
None today?
Let 's follow him to the others
Let me see what you 've got.
Coming to play with us, Durga?
Coming? If not, go home, I 'll be back soon
Like a sweet, Durga? Don 't give them any. If they want sweets, they should buy their own
Tunu, come and play
What lovely beads - Who gave them to you? - Father
What have things come to, when an old woman has to patch her shawl?
Durga, come here
You know it 's time to do your hair
- Can you plait four strands? - Don 't move your head
Ranu can What dry hair, and we have no oil. Never mind four - stranded plaits
Some people are coming to see if Ranu is a suitable bride Who are they?
Ever seen a train?
Don 't lie Do you know where the railway line is? Over the big meadow, beyond the rice fields
Now write the word... wealth
Were you good at school?
You 're so tiny; do the other boys tease you?
I 'm not surprised he' s left it He gets nothing but rice, but what else can I afford?
Wash your face
Where 's Durga?
Shall I fetch her toy - box?
She 's not well brought up
What has happened? Durga has stolen Tunu 's beads
Don 't look astonished; she is an accomplished thief
Her father bought the beads in town Tunu showed Durga
This morning the beads had vanished
Durga hasn 't been back; anyway, are you sure she took them?
Are you suggesting we 've invented it? - The string could have broken - It didn' t We 've searched everywhere
Did you take Tunu 's beads?
Didn 't you?
She 's a liar Where do you suppose she got that fruit?
What 's the matter? What' s going on?
The garden isn 't ours; it' s wrong to take the fruit But how can you accuse her of stealing something bought for money? She 's a child.
When you find the beads I hope you 'll return them
Our fruit disappears. I complain and the mother says: Suppose the children take it; fruit has no name on it
Come here
Tell Durga to come in for her meal
Then came an ogress, hobble, cackle, gobble
"I smell humans! Who is awake in my temple?"
Lue Lotus Prince kept guard while Red Lotus Prince slept
And at midnight the ogress came once more Hobble, cackle, gobble
"Who is awake in my temple?"
Father 's home
Give mother the fish
Put it down
Come here, I have lots to tell you
No matter what people say...... landlord Ray is a good man
My three months' wages First I will say evening prayers, then I have much to tell you
Today I met a rich farmer. I don 't know him...... but he greeted me and said my father knew him
He said my father officiated as a priest in his household Now he wants me to perform the same duties They 're having a religious ceremony next month
- They are rich - Have you agreed?
If I agree straight away, they 'll think we are starving Accept at once The trouble is that some people will criticize if they know
You might talk; you know what women are like I have better things to do with my time
Don 't be upset. The client won' t run away I mustn 't seem over - eager; he can wait until after the festival
And the repairs? We have survived the monsoon The repairs must wait, but I 'll get estimates
How many days to the festival?
Twenty - one
Did you take Tunu 's beads?
- Do you know who did? - No. Go to sleep
You once lived in Benares; did you have friends there? I had a few
Isn 't there a place by the river...... where men recite from the scriptures?
It 's called Dasasvamedh Ghat Let' s go to Benares.
Don 't the orators earn lots of money? We can' t go. How can we?
This is my ancestral home; how can I leave it? Why not? You were away eight years before
This is my home, too
But look at it: It 's like living in the forest
At night the jackals prowl around
There are no neighbours I can talk to
You are not always here and sometimes I 'm so depressed
You won 't understand these things
You live in your work. Sometimes you 're paid, sometimes not
I had dreams, too, of all the things I would do
Those who came before are gone am left behind, a penniless beggar Day draws to its close, night 's mantle descends Row me across to the other side
Hurry with the twigs, this wood is too damp to light
A new shawl, Auntie? How nice
What a lovely shawl, Auntie Raju gave it to me, to keep me warm in the evenings
We 're having a picnic; please cook something
Why is it never her turn to go and fetch things?
What 's the matter?
What 's that shawl?
It 's a present from Raju A present, was it? You didn' t ask?
I just remarked that the evenings were chilly, so he said... Would he feed you, too? Don 't be angry.
Whims? Don 't you realize that the children often go hungry? Are you going to dress and feed them?
I can always find somewhere else to go
Fine! Take yourself off
You 'd better go; you can' t stay here any longer
It 's lovely; your husband will enjoy your cooking
- When is the wedding? - I 've forgotten I know when
It 's in two months, isn' t it?
- What does it feel like? - Much the same - Tell me - You 'll find out
Raju, are you at home? - Who is it? - Your old auntie
I wonder whether you can take me in, just for a few days?
Only a few days I get no peace at the other place, nothing but nagging
Come in Tell your mother that Auntie has come to stay Bring her a chair and a bowl of water
Beware, King! If you utter those words again...... I shall cut out your tongue...... and throw it to the jackals and the dogs! And I shall destroy you, for the good of the world!
Durga, go and find the calf Please tie this on for me
Apu, let 's look for Auntie I want you to find the calf first What' s that?
Who gave you the silver paper?
- He 's been at my toy - box - You' re too old for a toy - box now He took my silver paper Go and find the calf
Stupid! Dressing up as a prince
Anyone at home? Why have you come back?
I 'm not feeling very well I' d like to spend my last days in the old home What 's the old home to you?
What are you waiting for? Let me rest here awhile
Sister - in - law, have you gone to sleep?
Will you give me some water? Your bowl is there; help yourself
Sit down
Eat it
Where are we?
What are those?
Those who came before are gone am left behind Row me across to the other side Day draws to its close, night 's mantle descends
Will you be away for long? About a week. I 'll call at Bistupar on the way back
Look, there 's father
Ask him for some money
Put the cat down and go and buy some molasses Apu wants rice pudding; he 's been asking for it for days
A letter!
Give it to me
arrived here yesterday The rich farmer has lost two sons...... so a ceremony s out of the question now ut don 't worry' il try to earn money for the repairs and then I 'll return home
Whatever God wills is for the best Give my love to Durga and Apu Charity, lady
Alms, good mother
Bless you. One day you will be goddess of wealth
Why didn 't you tell me?
You can 't go on like this; why didn' t you tell me? After all, we 're not strangers Every day I hope there will be some news
It never comes Five months now without news, without letters
Let Durga come with me; I 'll give her something to tide you over
- Don 't be silly - I can' t take it
I feel so ashamed
A letter!
No doubt you are worried because have not written for months Anyway, I have good news: Have been able to earn money shall be returning home soon
Holy Pond, Flower Garland, who prays here at noon?
I, fortunate sister of my brothers
Mother Goddess, counsel me, I know not how to pray
May I live in happiness with my husband Mother Goddess, grant me this boon
Rain, rain, go away...
Any news of Hori? He says he will be back this month Why is he away so long?
Have you any sago? I can let you have some If the fever continues to increase, apply cold compresses
No cause for alarm; just see that she doesn 't get another chill
We 'll go and see the train when I' m better, shall we?
We 'll have a good look next time
Durga is worse; can you come?
Sweep the yard. I 'm going to look at Durga
Fetch my husband; say I asked him to come - Is Durga asleep? - Yes.
Mother sends these vegetables. I 'll put them here
It would fall while I was away. Couldn 't it have waited?
How are you?
Are the children out?
Where are you going now? I 've brought some presents I' d have come earlier, if I could
A picture of Goddess Lakshmi, which you asked me to get A new sari for Durga
After this last year I have no affection for the old home
I don 't know what we would have done...... if you and your husband hadn' t helped us If we had done more, perhaps you would have stayed It 's not your fault, it' s just our bad luck
These fell in the storm; I thought you 'd like them for the journey How kind It' s only a few mangoes.
You 're really going tomorrow? Yes. Perhaps we should have told you before
Everyone should make a move once in a while
Staying in one place makes you mean; it 's done that to me
I 'd like to go away, too; I' ll see what my husband says
Don 't put yourself out on my account
I 've been confined to bed for over a month...... so I couldn' t come to see you I 'm told you' re moving to Benares; is that so? Yes, we 're leaving at dawn tomorrow
Think for a moment, is this a wise decision? You are Rajkestra 's son, Tarkalankar' s grandson Your family has lived here for generations
I wanted to be a writer; now my manuscripts are worm eaten I hoped to educate my boy, but it was not to be And the girl... she is at rest
Sometimes it is necessary to leave the ancestral home In town I may earn a little...... reciting from the scriptures

The Ballad of Narayama produced by Jiro Tomoda Goro Kusakabe By News Shichiro of Fukazawa Image:
What happened in the "new house"? Not much.
How is the old? So - so, it seems.
Tome, bring me the logs.
Grandma, how old are you?
Sixty - nine. You have beautiful tight teeth. You can eat pine cones and dried peas.
You didn 't count beyond 28. You' ve got more than that! Késakichi, shut up and work.
The old "home in the middle", his chance is great greater its chance The day he goes to the mountain, it 's snowing in large flakes
He is still sleeping, stink?
Risuke?
Our horse is hungry.
Have you been to the "new home" last night?
It is said by all cadets in the village you are said to kiss their dog.
I 've never done that. These people treat her as their own daughter.
The late head of the line had beaten to death a guy who slept with her.
I do not go, I tell you. You 're a junior, of course, but you' re my brother.
If you make such a mistake, I will be ashamed.
You stink of the mouth! Go away and I can 't breathe.
Hey, Uncle Jinsaku!
Why cook white rice at home?
Our mother is dying.
The old Okan?
Mom, white rice is cooked.
Uncle...
You have thrown the baby our rice? It bothers me that you have done that. The newborn?
The baby of my daughter, I buried in our cemetery. When? About ten days ago, I took him there and buried.
The one you saw must come from "the middle house." Again, there was a pregnant woman. That must be it.
It 's your turn to prepare the coffin.
Mom will soon die. I 'm counting on you.
Dis, Tsun! It was you who left a newborn in our rice? Yes.
What you stink! If I have another boy, I 'll throw it... In the rice stink.
Well, you 're the merchant of salt. Orin, that time passes. It' s been a year now.
Who? Tatsuhei? We were far from each other.
Orin, I came today to talk about something.
It 's salt!
But we have not yet decided about the little one. This is not why I 'm here. It is Yonékichi the village the other side that gives you the salt.
His wife will come from the village opposite.
Her name is Tamayan She is a widow for three days. She will come after her mourning.
I do not care.
Do not go near the smelly You have to obey him when he asks you to walk away. Késakichi is the heir.
Ginyan of "what the house is raining"......
Tatsuhei
Have you been to the mountain of the west this morning? No. The salt merchant saw you.
You look more like your father. Do you think he saw our father? He disappeared thirty years ago.
Do not cry.
Mom!
You do not know why Dad is gone?
This year, you had fifteen Risuke were five. A very poor harvest.
I had to sell the salt merchant a girl I had just born.
The mother of your father reached 69 age, time to go to Mountain. Narayama That she should go to that age With all that was under......
We must have the respect for the law. It does not work with our feelings.
For him it was beyond his courage, he fled.
To us it was a shame.
And you are like him? I will not be like my father. So that 's good.
My grandmother counting in a corner of cubbyhole the thirty - three hair that adorn her lower abdomen Matsu...
- How many hairs do you have down there? - I do not know. Then I 'll count them for you.
No, I do not want.
No, not here.
Oh, my ferns! I do not care...
Later...... I will pluck for you twice.
And also many other plants. Everything you want.
I 'll give you a lot.
You 'll see.
You 're hurting me.
Orin of "the house of the strain" in a corner of the closet It was attended thirty - three Devil 's Teeth You come home.
You can count how many teeth my mother has.
I was not paying attention. I only repeat it. But your son sings this.
He does not give me to eat. He wants me to starve. Who is it?
This is not the first time.
This winter, I will take him to the mountain. He will reach the age.
Your mother too will soon turn 70.
Orin of "the house of the strain" in a corner of the closet she met thirty - three Devil 's Teeth
Teeth of your grandmother the devil are they? You have been so spoiled by it. How can you sing so?
You will not have to eat!
You 're lucky, Orin. Why you say that? I want to live a little longer.
I do not want to die in my bed...... And be buried I know not where. It will not change.
As for mine, I do not know. Where could he have gone...... Leaving his gun in the mountains of the west?
You have had to spend hard times. Mostly, I was ashamed to the villagers.
Okan is dying. For when do you think? Tomorrow or after tomorrow By state.
In two months, you will have the woman from the village opposite. You will be relieved. Listen to me!
Is it too big?
She 'll be a cat which swells after his death.
It 's a beautiful coffin. How' s Okan? It just died.
Mama... You 're still alive? I restored since I ate white rice.
It 's white rice!
Go away. Fool!
There is nothing to do with them.
This fall, there is no good harvest.
A lot quackgrass already.
This is the party that you came? This is the home of Tatsuhei here?
Are you Tamayan, from the other side of the village?
With us also is the party, but I was advised to leave early...... To eat well here. I left that night.
Come in quickly.
Why did you stay on the stump? You should have come in the house. I was embarrassed to be coming alone.
My brother was with me. He was dead drunk at the party.
The Merchant of salt speaks to me well of you.
If I had known, I would get you gone. I would have then brought on my back.
I have already told the merchant of salt. I will go soon on the mountain.
You will also have good time to think.
But not... In making me earlier, the god up there to congratulate me.
These trout, it 's me that I caught.
Do you know fish for trout? In the village, no one can not get as much as me. I know where to find it.
I 'll take you there one day. Eat it all. I have a lot.
I 'll get Tatsuhei.
Do not be embarrassed. Continue to eat.
Just two teeth.
Risuke, you do not tell anyone.
What have you found? Give me that. I tell you it 's nothing.
The stink! What you stink!
You too, you 're a cadet. Do not make fun of me. I am your uncle.
Bastard!
You have all the time, eat well. I 'll get Tatsuhei.
I 'm old enough to go to the mountain. I do not have good teeth.
Make the post!
Tatsu strain a lucky
He married ten months and ten days after the death of his wife Késakichi!
Where is Tatsuhei?
Do not give up.
Jinsaku! How horrible!
It will not let go if it bites you. Orin strain in a corner of the closet it brought together thirty - three Devil 's Teeth
Takeyan, dear a woman came to replace you. With my son Tatsuhei Her name Tamayan
Takeyan, dear the party is over now You 'll stand the mountain Do not blame us
How good it is.
It 's better than before.
- The master has moved - The Master? He sends you his greetings.
Shiro, be nice.
Do not move!
Oei!
Listen to me. Hey, the Viper is burned out.
Our house is cursed. A curse we incur.
Instead of the niche, there was an old barn. This is where our dead chief a shot with a tree trunk...... A cadet of the village entering it in secret......
After my death,...... You 'll sleep with all the cadets of the village. One by one, each a night.
Ask these guys also to pray...... The god of our house. Without that, the curse...
I beg you... You redeem the crime.
I 'm counting on you.
I understand.
Fear not.
Father, be brave!
I repair this crime.
It 's not true! If it' s true!
Who did you know all this? This is the old man 's statement in the "new home". Who did he say that to?
How do you know then?
Because...... Through there, I heard it. The stinking, you went to that bitch last night.
You bastards!
Everyone is laughing at me.
God of the mountain...... I get rid of the smell.
And then the father of Oei die quickly.
Still your secrets. I know what you did last night.
I 've looked through the hole?
You spied on us?
It 's about mom' s teeth?
How? It forbids me to speak.
I 'm talking about Shiro!
You know what about mother 's teeth? It has not broken by falling?
I 'll give you one of those lessons.
You 're just stupid.
Mom! I liked your teeth solid like stones.
Your brother is very much like to his father. It strikes as soon as he is angry. Did Dad give you shots?
A shy man up immediately hand.
- It does not stink? - No, not at all.
My brother not never said that I stank.
It 's like a swing.
Well, it rains inside me... It 's out!
It looks like my belly has grown.
- when? - Next year.
Baby...... Myself...... My father......
Too bad!
Tomorrow, you will live with us. - Really?
This evening, each bowl, it must be said. You 're right.
You know how to make love...... But you know nothing of the lighting of a fire.
You 're very kind... It' s nothing. It is too much out there.
You not do it again!
Why have you saved? You 're probably right. This is boring having a baby mouse.
I 'm ready to accept it.
I 'm going to sleep.
We ask forgiveness to the god of Narayama!
We ask forgiveness God of Narayama have.
- Where is Tatsu? And Kesa? - They are gone.
I was going to sleep. Suddenly I heard noise outside. I caught this type that was to fly......
Come, delve his house.
That 's it, I found!
Are you sure there 's nothing left? Yes, that' s all.
Do you realize? Their field would not produce less than half. I doubt that I harvest so little.
Excuse me. Our family is so large. Who did all these kids like a beast?
Késakichi! Have mercy on us. Our daughter marrys you, is not it?
This is a family of thieves. This is not the first time they do that. It is not Oei.
The beans are very tasty, I should taste a bit. Will you only eat or work on the mill also? What do you mean?
She did not come to marry Késakichi. She has been kicked out of her home. She must be pregnant for five months.
Do we have enough to feed this winter?
You can not leave these people as they are. We must act quickly to be able to sleep peacefully. Otherwise, they will resume.
If you have to kill the family...... We will not let Matsu apart.
You should prepare youself there.
But she 's with us like daughter. - The baby has our blood. - Is that a reason that counts?
No, not at all.
As they say,...... You start to look like your father.
Who dared to say that I looked like my father?
Discuss all that good With Orin.
We 'll make a game just now.
Idiot! This is actually three lots. Okay?
There will be one that will lose. No complaints!
That 's it!
I win.
I have more.
I 'm sorry.
It would be nice to have a girl child.
A girl that you do not have to kill, you can sell it. Matsu!
There they will have nothing to eat tonight. Take these to them.
You just stay there to take care of yours.
That 's it, it' s well done.
Tatsuhei! Risuke!
You stay here. - Why? - Nothing.
Is it good?
No! Let me go! Wait!
Wait! Listen to me!
Stop! You bastards! Matsu is pregnant.
Let us go!
Grandma...
What happened to "the house where it rains"?
Where is Matsu? Shut up. Do not ever talk about it in this house.
Come here and warm up.
Grandma...... You deceived us. Késakichi!
You had returned Matsu home.
Why?
Why did you do that?
It was you who killed her!
The slut!
The devil!
Mama...... Why didn 't you speak to us?
This winter...... Go to the mountain.
My mother went. Me stepmother as well. I too have to go.
It 's very hard to live here.
I shall see Matsu in the mountains.
When I see her...
Do not worry. We have one less mouth. The baby is gone.
Even in cold weather, we do not put clothing cotton lined... can not you covered.
One must also pray, fool. You pray the god of the house. Get A Life.
Get yourself naked.
Get on me, quick!
No, it 's not there.
That 's it. Come on, shake your hips.
How nice!
I enjoy!
The day before yesterday was Katsuzo, and then yesterday, it was Gen. It tours from west to east. This will be my turn tonight!
It will be great!
La voila!
This fucking Oei!
The poor smelly!
She did not want you, well done! You, your wife was killed. Thou shalt have no wife.
The one that wants to be my wife...... Here it is already.
You laugh, too. Are you kidding me! Filthy beast!
I 'm running out of patience.
Species of idiot!
I was told Oeï jumped your turn. I do not care of it. You should not lose his head.
I 'll take care. I' ll give you a chance.
Will Oei pick me? No, not that bitch there.
It will be just for one night. Not more than that. When?
One night, right?
Accept what I asked you last night. Supports it a night.
What do we become the horse dies?
This winter, it will be hard enough. I 'm afraid he sacked the rice field.
Please, sleep with him, just once.
We do not even potatoes to pay his daughter. Who lost the potatoes to the game?
I know it does not please you, but accept... All right! Just one time!
Risuke no longer working,...... Since you 've ruled out of the tour.
The smell disgusts you. But I beg you to stand overnight. I 'm sorry, I can not.
I 'd die.
You should follow the will of your father. Did he say to let my son out?
I went to his grave this morning. I asked and he agreed. Suddenly I emerged large butterfly......
I do not smell, or very little. So, smell does not bother me. Can you accept it?
I have no reason to tell you no.
I have not used till now. Can I still do that? Do not worry.
I 'm leaving tomorrow Narayama.
I call tonight people who have been there. It 's too early. Tell them quickly.
Mom!
Go quickly to prevent them all...... Before they go to work.
I just saw your husband. Where? In the meadow of the mountain in the west, I saw it happen.
You, Rihei?
Is it his spirit?
Even if he returns back after all these years...... I do not forgive. You just wandering here and there.
At fifteen, I went to hunt with Dad.
I killed him to return here.
I told him on reflection,...... It was better to wear the mother in the mountains.
He was angry, saying that I did not understand. It has been played, we fought. I shot with his gun......
I loved your father...... But the whole village laughed at him. It 's not you, but the god of the mountain that killed him.
Do not ever talk to anyone.
Reduce heat now.
When you 're done that, bring the pot of sake. Do not forget to wipe the bottom.
It 's a bit early, but take your bath now. Tome, you can stop.
Come with me.
You 're so clever! During the day, you can see trout swimming. If you approach the water, they hide under a rock.
Tatsuhei asked you to give your body for one night to his brother. Do not do that. You have to say no outright.
Go. Pass the hand below.
I 've caught one! You see, that' s fine.
I have nothing more to teach you. You know everything. Do not tell no one of this place.
The pilgrimage to the mountain is painful. We appreciate your courage.
Excellent sake. Orin, this preparation...... Is really worthy of you.
We must respect the rules of the pilgrimage. One of them is: on the way it is forbidden to exchange a word.
Another one is: you have to leave home...... Without being seen by anyone.
The path to take: around Mount and go under the holly. After the slope of the third mountain, there is a pond. Bypass the pond three times and climb a hill.
Continue to advance and along the valley. Two and a half miles later...... To go through seven turns.
After having crossed...... You get to Narayama.
Climb, climb, and god will be waiting.
On the way back...... You should never look back.
If it displeases you to go through,...... You can stop you before the summit.
This is something you do not be said in secret. I have told you anyway.
It can still be used.
What is it? He cut the rope with his teeth. What a shame!
You are unworthy to appear before the god. Will you break your bonds with God and with your son?
Come, go home.
That 's stupid!
What 's this?
The teeth of a rabbit, it brings good luck.
Is it back?
Mom, you 're tired?
No, I do not want. What about you?
All of our ancestors...... Moved here has always...... To go to the mountain.
Hundreds Thousands of people...... Perhaps more.
Twenty - five years...... Go to the mountain brought on the back of my son.
Twenty - five years later...... This will be his turn.
There is nothing to do.
Is it true that up there... The god of the mountain us?
If there really...... To make it snow, as the song goes!
I killed my father...... And I killed my mother.
Let me go!
Father!
Go to the mountain!
It 's snowing!
It 's snow.
Mom!
It starts to snow.
You must be cold.
You 're lucky, because it snow...... On the day of your pilgrimage.
It is true that snow.
It was so cold.
It began to snow. What luck. You must be hungry.
What 's wrong?
It 's lucky our grandmother. It' s like what the song says.
It smells really good.
From tonight...... She eats here.
If it makes cold, clothing lined with cotton wool, can not you covered. If it is hard to Narayama, when it snows a lot, you are happier
Pelle the Conqueror
- Papa...
- I 'm sleeping. Tell me about it again, papa. It' s very different this new country.
- You 'll hardly... - You' ll hardly believe your eyes. They put raisins in the pork roast and butter on your bread...
They won 't fool me. Shouldn' t take the first offer that comes along.
This is my boy. No, widower. We 're from Tommelilla.
My name is Lasse Karlsson I 'm looking for work.
That one looks like he 'd be kind to children.
Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla. I 'm looking for work. Go back to Sweden, you old devil.
Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla. I 'm looking for... No... shouldn' t take the first offer that comes along.
I 'm Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla. I' m looking...
Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla. I 'm looking for work. You' re too old, and the boy is too young.
Shouldn 't take the first offer that comes along.
No...
You 're too late.
I suppose you 're looking for work.
Where are your parents?
Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla. I 'm looking for... Let me see your papers.
I 'll hire you for 100 crowns a year...... including the boy.
Good Lord...
You 'll be staying in there.
If you have any questions ask me or the trainee.
Come back here, you stupid animals!
Come back here, you miserable creatures. Come on.
Move it. Come on.
H it them on their teats. Or their hind legs, then they 'll listen.
Just hit them.
Get back I said.
If you help me with the cows and teach me Danish...... we can share my food.
Always keep a stone in your pocket. If one runs away...... hit her with it and call her name. She 'll come back then she' ll know who 's boss.
- Rut? - Rud. Stick your tongue out.
If you stick your head between your legs and the sun is above the trees...... it 's time to give them water. You can also hear it by the larks' song.
That 's my mother. She can' t say Rud either.
Here 's my food.
Stablehand, why is that cow standing there?
Why is Gabriella standing there?
Why is Gabriella standing there?
The girls can 't find their cows when you move them around. Aspasia it says.
Perhaps Mr. trainee could tell me where she is suppose to stand.
Kongstrup is back!
Erik, why haven 't you unharnassed Kongstrup' s horses?
Because I am going to eat my food first. Oh, really? You 're not gonna leave these horses there, while you eat.
Don 't you know its forbidden to steal the milk?
You should be whipped for that!
Well, never mind this time.
Hey, Pelle... I 've been thinking. You and your father want to get rich?
If you can keep a secret.
Come in here, Pelle, very quietly. The raven can be dangerous if it hears us.
Come.
Mr. trainee!
Mr. trainee, sir!
Jump, you stinking Swede!
You dirty bastard!
Do you want to taste the whip yourself?
Stop it or I 'll turn you both in to the authorities.
Get out and don 't show your face for a good while. You son - of - a - bitch!
He 'll be punished. You can be sure. - On my word of honor...
I 'll... - Kill him.
- That dirty bastard... - Promise you 'll kill him? - You can count on it, Pelle.
With a hammer, I think... You 'll kill him stone dead... Like a dead dog?
But who 'll read the cows' names then?
You 're right... Yes... We' d better make it just a whipping.
Yarn for the boy 's grey socks. The patch was for... The Sunday sweater, said Bengta.
Your mother was so worried. She didn 't think I could take care of you. Count on me, Bengta.
Don 't wear the socks too long, she said. Don' t wear them through. Lasse!
Lasse?
It 's the trainee.
Lasse, where the hell are you, you Swedish bumpkin? Will you kill him now, papa?
Yes, yes...
Mr. trainee... I want to protest against... Mr. trainee...
Ex cuse me.
I just want to protest about the way Pelle was... Are you deaf? Watch out I don 't report you to the manager.
Aspasia is not going out to pasture tomorrow.
- Is she going to calve? - Did you think she was foaling?
You can lie there and cry, but if one can 't read Aspasia' s name...... one ought to show a little respect. I know where Aspasia 's stall is. She' s the third one from the door.
Are you so proud you won 't speak your mother - tongue anymore?
Lasse is old and poor... No respect... They can do what they want with you.
What good does it do to make a fist...... when there 's no strength left? I' m getting older... But you 're young, Pelle...
I nearly forgot... Look here. Look, Pelle...
I brought it with me from Sweden.
From Tommelilla.
If we 're lucky, we' ll get wild strawberries.
Just think, Pelle... Real Swedish strawberries.
N ils, get your father some water.
N ils, how about that water?
Watch out!
What the hell are you doing son?
Where have you been? The Missus sent me to the store.
What 's that you' re hiding under your jacket, Pelle?
The Missus said I wasn 't to show it to anyone.
You 're a clever boy, Pelle.
If you give me the bag, I 'll give it to the Missus...... so no one sees it.
Cognac...
Give it to me.
I won 't move. The boy should know that you take my things.
Don 't do it!
Give me that bottle, Kongstrup! You lousy bastard! Pelle, go down and tell them how he bullies me.
Keep it.
God who keeps his children near, look at me who 's kneeling here. My happiness is in God' s hands, whatever are the world 's demands. - Happiness comes, happiness...
- Papa?
Tomorrow you can say the day after tomorrow.
And the day after tomorrow, you can say tomorrow. - My birthday. - Oh, yes...
Pelle, the cognac he poured out...... was it real cognac?
lnto the flower pot?
Happiness comes, happiness goes.
You better get dressed.
Trousers, Pelle. Trousers first.
But what 's in your pocket? You haven' t been stealing eggs last night, have you?
Let 's see.
Oh, it 's only paper.
Why do you stuff your pockets?
Happy birthday and God bless you, son.
Thank you.
It 's just a poor man' s gift, Pelle.
Look.
Now that 's really something!
It 's a birthday present.
I should have guessed. You look like someone who 's got a birthday.
Happy birthday.
They say... Are you really going to run away to America?
Run away... Run away, Pelle. Do I look like an idiot?
I want to be free, Pelle. A free man.
That 's what I' m waiting for.
A free man.
Come and see.
Look here, Pelle.
This... This is the boat to America. I 've got two years left to work on this damn farm.
Across the ocean.
First to America, then to China, Spain, Negroland. The whole damn world, Pelle. It 's there, waiting for you, Pelle.
- I 'm coming with you.
Yes.
Since it 's your birthday, I' ll let you come along. Remember, in two years, as soon as the snow begins to melt...... we 'll go out and conquer it.
That great, awful...... wonderful world.
Now.
There you are.
We 've always eaten wild strawberries on your birthday.
Think... real Swedish strawberries.
How far is America, papa?
America?
Very far. There 's a big mighty ocean between us.
Erik says the sea is the strongest there is.
It 's soft and yet it can hold anything up. lron or rock.
I wonder if the countries America and China are attached...... to the ocean bottom or do they drift freely about?
Then they would be hard to find.
They 're firmly fix ed to the ocean bottom, I imagine.
Kongstrup!
Come out, Kongstrup. I want to talk to you!
- Your lad is hungry! - The sow and the cabbagehead... Kongstrup, your bastard son needs money for food!
Where are you going, you cabbagehead? Stay here. Come out and say hello to your bastard son.
- Get out, you disgusting sow. - Kongstrup has to pay his due. Kongstrup!
You 'll never get rid of us!
Kongstrup!
Kongstrup!
Take good care of your slate now, Pelle. And stay out of the way of the big boys, until you can handle them. But if they won 't leave you alone, you hit first and run hard.
Remember to use your handkerchief. Do not use your fingers.
But if no one 's looking, then you can save the handkerchief.
Take care of your sweater, now that I 've mended it. If the teacher' s wife invites you to coffee, take only one piece cake. - But she won 't.
B - A is ba. B - E is be. B - A is ba.
Quiet! Quiet! You rascals!
Let us welcome the new pupil.
Stand up.
- Tell us your name. - Pelle Karlsson.
And what can you do?
I can hit a cow with a stone from a hundred paces.
And I can make my cows stand still by buzzing like a wasp. - And I can make Bismarck... - Can you read?
Leave your impudent remarks at home.
What 's this one, Pelle? Don' t think I 've ever seen that one. Have you already forgotten?
- It 's an F. - Of course. That' s what it is.
It 's the first letter in F - ternoon. Of course. But you didn' t figure that out alone.
You did? You 're getting clever, Pelle. There' s no end to what a lad with so much book learning can do.
Maybe we 'll get roast pork with raisins, Pelle.
Or with apples. Some places they make it with apples instead.
We 'll see.
Get out! I don 't want any more trouble with you. - Get out!
Damned! Damned!
Damn the Stone Farm.
Does anyone else have any complaints?
Scram, you oaf! What are you doing here? Go back to the other oafs.
Get lost, Pelle! You could get dizzy and fall in the water.
Go home, Pelle!
- Go back to the other oafs. - Get lost, yellow - belly!
Go home, yellow - belly! I 'm no more that than you! You don' t even dare jump in the water.
You must be crazy, jumping into the water...... like some love - sick woman.
A good beating is what you need. If you had drowned I 'd have given you such a beating, believe me. To think I should be the father of such a half - witted idiot.
Do you think, doctor, he 'd be better if you bled him?
Here you are. This will help your cold.
Don 't be afraid, Pelle. I' m not a witch.
Just very unhappy sometimes.
Oh, dear Lord...... you don 't even have a mother, poor thing.
It 's three years since Mama Bengta died.
She 's lying in the left - hand corner of the cemetery now.
Do you miss her much?
Lasse mends my clothes. She was a good mother to you, wasn 't she?
She was so ill and grouchy at the end. It was better that she died.
But we 'll marry again soon.
And then you 'll leave.
You don 't like it here anyway, do you?
Nobody likes it at Stone Farm. Everything turns bad here.
It must be an old curse. Is that what they say?
Well, well... And what do they say about me?
That Missus has a pact with the devil...... and turns into a werewolf at night.
And just because I love only one man.
Why does he do this to me? He 's gone into town again, the lecher. I married him, made him a proprietor...... gave him my love.
You 're a good boy, Pelle.
If I had a son, I would want him to be like you.
Papa, there 's the Missus with her young family.
Pelle, you step forward.
Hello, Pelle. Where 's your father?
This is our stablehand, Lasse Karlsson and his son Pelle. Hello.
This is my niece from Copenhagen. Miss Signe is going to stay with us.
I 've forgotten what 2 x 2 is.
Even if my knowledge is somewhat rusty...... I 'll see if I can help you.
2 x 2 is 5.
Which is lighter, a pound of feathers or a pound of lead? Not you, Pelle.
Perhaps Pelle would be so kind as to repeat his question.
If a pound of flour costs 12 øre, what does a barrel of gunpowder cost?
Where the hell 's the herring? That' s all I ever eat.
Herring, herring, herring! Do you know the difference between you and a buttock?
I don 't know either.
Erik, did you hear what I asked? Lasse, can you take my place at the chaff - cutter tonight? But it 's Saturday.
I 'm going out to have some fun.
You 're not getting off so easy.
He 's got a way with women, like his papa. It must be a hell of a long time since Lasse Karlsson... Karna, I' ve been thinking lately...
So you 're out fishing for young men.
Watch out you don 't miss the boat. Lasse, run down to the store and get us some brandy. Come on, damn it.
Papa!
I had hoped when we came here...... that there would be some money left to buy a little house...... and maybe find a woman, who could take care of us.
Then we could have coffee in bed Sunday mornings, eh Pelle? We could run away together, papa. Run away...
We have to get away.
What are you doing here?
- Stealing eggs. I was so hungry. - Don 't tell anyone you saw me.
I know who the father is.
You mustn 't tell anyone.
H is father would... If he knew, he would... I 'm not good enough for them.
Never.
Pelle!
Come here!
- What were you doing there? - Stealing eggs.
Bend over.
Can I have your half - crown? Have my half - crown? Are you crazy?
When I 'm bigger I' ll give you back ten. You 'll never get big. You' re deformed.
I 'll go on show... at tivolis.
At tivolis? As a monster. I 'll get filthy rich.
But Pelle...... give it to me and you can beat me 100 times with nettles.
On your bare skin?
A hundred times.
- You can 't take that. - As hard as you want.
A hundred blows. Are you ready?
That 's enough.
Then you don 't get the money. You hit too hard.
- You want it or not? - The money first, then.
Can 't you tell us anything about Adam and Eve and the serpent?
Well?
We 're waiting.
Have you ever heard of Adam and Eve and the serpent?
Haven 't you been listening in class?
What did the serpent promise them if they ate from the apple?
Don 't think I feel sorry for you.
It promised that if they could distinguish between good and evil.
How can we let you continue in this class...... if you don 't understand the most elementary things? Are his parents here?
They are not even here. All right, sit down.
Ne xt... Pelle.
Perhaps you can tell us what God said to the serpent? And God said to the serpent, You shall...
You shall crawl on your belly...
You shall crawl on your belly... - And does it still do so? - Yes, because it has no limbs.
A limb is... A limb moves independently. An e xample?
Ears. - Can you move the ears? - Yes.
So your ears saved you. I always told you to use your ears.
Rud!
Rud, you idiot. Come back!
If you run away you 'll never get to your grandma in heaven.
You can have my knife if you come back.
You can 't do that to me.
What are you doing?
Don 't remove those stones. The child is buried there.
Yes it is... Anna killed your child and she was sent to jail.
I did it... I killed the child.
Papa could never kill me.
Why can 't you leave me alone?
It 's my meadow, and you mustn' t take the stones away from the child.
You mustn 't say that. You mustn' t lie before God. The child is in the cemetery, in consecrated earth.
N ils!
Who has gone out there into the arms of death? It 's N ils. He went out with the line.
Your eyes are young. Can you see N ils?
He was a good boy.
He was my everything. My light... my warmth.
He never spoke an evil word. Even though I denied him his love.
Now I 'm without a son. Without a child.
May he find peace now. He had so little of it here on earth.
He rescued the lives of five men. Maybe now Our Lord will receive him.
Come on, Erik. Come on! Two more inches and you 've won yourself a bottle of brandy.
When will you drink it? The Manager says you have to work. He can work if he wants, the bloody Stone Farm manager.
Not now... Remember in one year... When the snow melts, then we 'll go out into the real world.
The whole damn world, Pelle.
Where are you going? You scoundrel! Erik!
What 's this? Are you ill? I must have caught a cold.
Always trouble with you. Never satisfied with the food. - Always complaining about work.
There must be authorities in this country.
Now you do your job...... or I 'll show you the authorities.
The manager wants you to be quiet.
What are you saying, you little chicken?
- The manager wants you...
- I can 't hear you.
The manager wants you to be quiet.
Listen to him. Listen to that stupid boy. He is still wet behind the ears.
Run back and tell him to run his own errands.
Skol!
Skol, you devil!
Good Lord... I 'm not dead yet.
- Where are you going, Erik? - To rest. - What?
No. You have to do your job. - I 'm allowed to rest.
- I always have to work. - What a pity.
That 's because you' re so clever...... and yell such loving words at me when I turn my back.
What the hell do you think you get your money for? Are you so goddamn stupid? You have to work for your wages.
I 'll have to go to the authorities and report you...... and keep your wages. All your wages, Erik. Fine.
Papa! Lasse! They 're coming.
Good Lord... They 're going to do it.
Carry him down to the cellar.
Carry him down to the cellar!
The rest of you go back to work.
Come inside and get warm. I just wanted to get out of the wind.
The mama Bengta died and now she 's in the cemetery back home.
And your father is a widower?
I think that 's what it' s called.
The sea is hard. My husband 's been out there for a year now. I' ve been a widow since.
Has he drowned?
No, he hasn 't. I haven' t had an omen yet.
How long did you say her husband has been at sea? A year, I think.
So she 's been alone a whole year.
That 's a long time.
And you told her that mama Bengta was dead? Yes, of course you did.
This is all we have left of mama 's things.
It 's all or nothing now, Pelle.
You go by Madame Olsen 's place after school tomorrow...... and give her this.
As a thank you for her kindness to you in the storm.
Would you believe it, Pelle...... I got an omen last night in that awful storm. I dreamt that a big black dog stood at my bed.
H is coat was dripping wet...... and I understood it had to be the shipdog with a message. I got out of bed...... and outside my window I saw a ship go down.
The heavens and the sea met.
I saw my husband rise to heaven.
He was completely transparent. Saltwater dripped off him.
- Who 's there? - Pelle' s father, Lasse Karlsson.
So that 's Pelle' s father.
It 's quite a young son you have.
Come in and sit down.
He was a late - comer you might say.
But I can still do a man 's work, both here and there.
- Here you are. - Thank you.
I really ought to be going. Eat.
Go ahead, eat. That 's how you know a man.
You 've walked a long way. I just wanted to thank you for being so kind to the boy. Nonsense.
- You must have been a good wife. - That 's true enough. He got everything that was his due when he was ashore.
I don 't think mama Bengta would have said that about me. There' s plenty to do in this house, if there 's a man to help.
I only have one cow...... but one could have two.
I 'm only a poor devil compared to you...... but we have decent clothes. And I have a pair of good hands.
- You 're not afraid of lending a hand. - No, I' m not.
I 'm not afraid of...... a cup of coffee in bed Sunday morning either.
Then I think I should have a kiss.
Yes, you should.
We must hope for happiness and blessings for all three of us. You already like the boy. I know that.
You 'd better stay the night.
But I must be back before the cows wake.
And Pelle 's all alone.
Pelle...
Come on, Pelle.
Everything 's been arranged now. We' ll have a house and home. And a beautiful mother too.
And maybe we 'll get coffee in bed Sunday mornings.
Give us this day our daily bread... Is that the book of biblical stories?
Does it have the one about the man whose sons pulled down his pants? - Noah? - Yeah, old man Noah.
- What did he drink, old man Noah? - Wine. Was it wine?
The great prophets. Let me see... lsaiah and Daniel...
Let 's hear them. Well, first I have to make sure I have them all.
I don 't understand where they have gone. There' s lsaiah... and Daniel...
No, I can 't do it today, Pelle. - Think of how old I am. - lsaiah, Daniel...
lsaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel... - And... and... - Jeremiah!
And Jeremiah! lsaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel and Jeremiah.
Will you never grow up?
Don 't be afraid. He wouldn' t hurt a fly.
Erik are you coming?
To the fair, Erik.
Come on, Erik.
Come on!
Come on, Erik.
Isn 't he coming?
He can 't stay alone here without the manager.
Can 't you go get him? You' re the only one he Iistens to. Coming with us to the fair, Erik old boy?
Come on, Erik. Come on!
Aren 't you coming to the fair?
lsaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel, Jeremiah. lsaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel, Jeremiah. Those were the days.
Smile at the world, and the world smiles back at you.
What 's going on here?
I 'm leaving, Aunt.
But Signe, dear child... I don 't really Iike Iiving in the country.
I want to learn to take care of myself. I 've decided to...
- You might have said something. - I should have said it earlier. But dear child, I don 't understand.
I miss the city so... But I thought... Kongstrup and I were sure you were happy here.
Dear Signe... I 'm sorry, Aunt, but I don' t think... So suddenly.
- Sorry, Aunt. - But you might have... Why can 't you look me in the eye when we talk?
How will you manage the trip? - And so suddenly...
- Kongstrup will take me to the boat. Oh thank God. I was so worried.
I imagined Kongstrup and I, we would sit here...... and watch you run this glorious place. Signe, my dear, don 't cry. My dear...
Kongstrup!
Kongstrup!
Come out and let me talk to you.
You owe me money, Kongstrup.
Kongstrup!
Miss Signe... Let me say hello to you.
Are you too proud to say hello to me? One person 's just as good as another.
Is it because you 're going away to have your child? I had mine in a turnip patch. But it was the same old whoremonger, wasn' t it?
Signe... Signe.
Go up to the old whoremonger. I 'm afraid of the Missus.
- Come on. - Let me go!
Kongstrup, come out and help an old sweetheart! Let me go! Let me go!
What are you staring at?
- Why are you late? - Sorry.
I don 't understand. Only death can put an end to grief so quickly. She must have a damned good grip on herself.
Wake u p and fetch the doctor. Quick!
- What is it, papa? - I don 't know.
What is it? What happened? - It 's so terrible.
The Missus cut him. He 's bleeding badly. Get help.
See what it says about Pelle.
Could Master Friis teII me what this means?
"Pelle is the young cuckoo in Madame Olsen 's nest." - Isn' t she married to a sailor? - She 's boatsman Olsen' s wife.
Your father doesn 't care, does he, Pelle? Watch out lecher' s son! Pelle 's father Iikes married women.
Pelle 's father is a whoremonger.
He 's in for a beating.
The cuckoo bird is in for a beating. Here 's one from boatsman Olsen.
Just wait, Pelle, we 'II get you.
Pelle... I 've been turning it over in my mind... Shouldn' t we move down to Madame Olsen 's?
I 've talked to her about it.
It 's against the law to move in with someone who' s stiII married...... but my whole body aches sometimes to have my own.
Pelle, we could make it look Iike we were lodgers.
She could sew you new clothes. You 're growing out of the old ones.
If I move into Madame Olsen 's, you' d come too, wouldn 't you?
It 's easy for you, Pelle. You have your years ahead of you. I' m beginning to get old and I need someone to take care of me.
You 're so smug and proud. Look how you' re cutting up the post...... and someone e lse has to fiII in the holes with cow dung. Stop that now, Pelle!
Pelle!
Could you go by Madame Olsen on the way home from school?
Here are some things she promised to mend for us.
And teII her I 'II come by this eveni ng. Why don' t you marry her properly Iike others do. We wiIl...
But soon there wiII be coffee in bed.
WeIl, here 's Madame Olsen' s young cuckoo.
Let 's see how strong you are, Pelle.
- Into the sea with him! - Jump, Pelle!
Whoremonger 's son!
Go back to Sweden!
Let 's see how good you are.
- Into the sea with him! - Jump, Pelle! - Show us what you can do.
Look! It 's boatsman Olsen!
Are you back already?
Madame Olsen 's husband has come home.
First they pluck one feather and then another. And finally you stand there Iike a plucked chicken in the shit. I thought I was going to have a peacefuI old age.
Oh, Jesus.
Jesus, help me.
What 's the point of grieving?
Here... this is my new sweetheart.
Kiss her, lad.
Oh, you 're too fine for that, are you?
WeII it doesn 't help to go around whimpering.
Stop it, papa.
Frisky isn 't she?
Easy now, you devil!
You 're crying, son.
Has someone hurt you? Don 't you know your father' s name is Lasse Karlsson? It 's alright.
You can be sure he 'II prove...
Your father can stand on his own two feet.
Now the bastard 's going to answer for all these years. We' II have a talk with Missus and her whoremonger.
Erik?
Spring is coming. That 's what papa says.
Then you 'II be a free man.
We can leave, Erik.
We can leave this awfuI place...... and go out and conquer the world, Erik.
Pelle... - What do they say about us? - Wouldn 't know.
The Lord forgive me for abusing his gifts...... but it 's a terrible temptation when you' re broken - hearted.
If I promise you 'II never again see your father Iike yesterday...... would you then go to school tomorrow, Pelle? We' II puII through this.
You have to go or there wiII be trouble with the authorities.
Master Friis? Master Friis? He 's sleeping.
Master Friis, it 's two o' clock. Time to go home.
WeIl, Pelle... Where 's your father?
Is he out running about?
I 'm sure my father would be happy to marry him...... as boatsman Olsen' s second wife.
Help me!
How dare you hit my son, you scoundrel?
You 'II hear from the authorities about this!
That was about the worst you could do, hit the minister 's son. He deserved it, I' m sure, but stiII you should n 't have done it. They' II send you away.
He said he could get you married as boatsman Olsen 's second wife. Oh, he did... Did he!
If I had him here, I 'd rip his innards out. - Did you give him what he deserved? - No, not really.
This isn 't good.
And you don 't intend to apologize?
No, no you shouldn 't.
Although maybe you should... No, no. You have to twist and turn as the eel said in the frying pan.
I hope the proprietor won 't mind. We have no choice, but to ask for help.
Did you blow your nose properly, Pelle?
I hope the proprietor won 't mind.
- There 's probably no one home. - We can' t stand here all day. Go first then, if you think you can handle this better.
Good day.
It 's Iike this you see... I hope the proprietor won' t mind... That he won 't mind...
Forgive us for coming, this has nothing to do with the farm.
But when the sins of a father are visited upon his son, then...
Are you standing there? Sit down by all means.
Why haven 't you offered them a seat, dear?
What is it? Money?
No, it 's j ust that...
I hope Ma 'am won' t mind, but it 's...
It 's the boy. They' re going to send him away. Send him away?
I hit and kicked the minister 's son. And why did you do that?
Because he said eviI things about Lasse.
What did he say?
He called me boatsman Olsen 's second wife. Like, in the story in the bible, I suppose.
I was... Madame Olsen 's sweetheart. Everyone thought she was a widow and then...
Have one.
- And then Pelle got furious. - Yes, unfortunately. That 's how it is with poor wretches.
Oh by the way, Kongstrup and I decided. The old trainee is leaving us this Spring. Maybe Pelle would Iike to become trainee here on Stone Farm.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Did you notice how I let the Missus know you 'd Iike to be trainee? Almost as if she thought it was her own idea.
These belonged to the old trainee. They 're a bit big. Try them on, Pelle?
I 'II get some boot wax, and they' II be Iike new. WeII the n...
Stand up straight, Pelle. Shoulders up and chin forward. No, Iift your chin.
No more hard work. Just giving orders. "You can 't take tonight off.
And Pelle, maybe you 'II get to eat Sunday dinner with the proprietor. And have your own napkin - ring with your name on it. Pelle Karlsson written on it.
And who knows, Pelle. Maybe one day you 'II be the manager. I could see what the Missus thought.
Erik!
Erik!
Wait, Erik! Wait for me!
I won 't...
We have to leave here, papa.
Now, papa!
- Oh, it 's Karna. - I' m glad I caught you. I was afraid the manager and the Missus would see me.
Goodbye, Gabriella.
Goodbye, Blakka. Be good.
WeIl, Aspasia. Say good bye to Pelle, cause he 's going out to see the big world.
Papa...
What is it?
Can 't we stay?
You 'II have to run away without me, Pelle. I' m too old to travel. I don 't have the strength anymore.
I 'm too old.
Do you understand that?
We 'II make a bundle for you. You can have two of my shirts then you' II have four. The one you 're wearing is clean.
And you can have my boots too.
Though they 're a bit worn.
And here 's the Bible.
Mama Bengta wanted you to have it the day we parted.
N ext time we 'll meet maybe you' ll have a proper home to come to.
Say hello to Karna for me.
Goodbye and thank you.

MlSHA PHlLIPCHU K Sanja as a child in a PAVEL CHUKHRAI film THE THlEF
I was born just after the war... in 1946. My mother was going to see some relatives in Jaroslavl '... and she gave birth to me on the side of the road. I never saw my father.
THE THlEF In 1952, I was six. My memory then confused... what I saw and understood after that.
Get rid of one. = What should I get rid of? = Hearts. Hearts... I don 't have any.
- Mommy! - What? Can I go up there?
So who is the queen married to? The jack or the king? The queen?
That 's enough, I' ve had it.
HeIlo.
HeIlo.
Let 's play some more.
Cards, huh? Just Iike at home.
Come on.
I 've been robbed!
= Where are you going without shoes? - What 's going on?
A woman was robbed. People.
Stay in your seat. = I 'm going, you stay here. - Mom, please!
Listen, squirt. Here you go. What are you doing?
Keep an eye on my stuff, okay?
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Iet us through.
Why cry? It 's too Iate.
ShaII we have a smoke?
Are you crazy! What 's your name? Mine?
Daddy!
Where are you going?
WeIl... I don 't know.
We got off with Uncle Tol jan in some random city. My mom said that from then on we would live with him... and that I would have to call him Dad.
We walked through the city... looking for a room or a small apartment to rent.
Do you have a room?
The accountant and his wife Iive there. An engineer and his daughter, there. Here 's the kitchen.
The bathroom.
An artist Iives here, my husband and I there.
Varvara teaches the accordion there.
A drunk woman lives in there, but she 's harmless.
The room isn 't mine, it' s my sister Anna 's. She' s in the hospitaI now.
And I 'm Aunt Tanja.
Sanjec 'ka.
Aunt Tanja.
I 'Il give you the down payment in a few days. My housing money and passport are at the military headquarters. You know how the army is.
Okay. Whenever. You 're a father, a soldier. = You' re not a con artist. = Thanks.
Mommy!
What 's wrong? Calm down.
It 's nothing, honey.
= What 's wrong. Sanja? = It' s nothing. He 'II go back to sleep now.
What are you saying?
I heard it, you know?
You were dreaming.
I 'm sleeping here!
Not on your Iife!
Lie down here.
I 'm staying with mommy.
Goddammit! I sleep here. If you say another word.
So?
Don 't worry.
Put a naiI up.
Why? To hang up your uniform.
Okay, I 'II put it up myself.
And what are these? They 're for you, I bought them at the market.
Just for me? For you, for you.
For me?
It 's for me?
It doesn 't fit.
Stop it.
Stop it, get out.
And don 't make any noise, or they' II send us away.
Your passport isn 't at headquarters. You never went there. I' m on Ieave.
You 're Sasha?
My name is Inessa Pavlovna.
Are you the drunk? No.
- I haven 't had a drink in a month. - Sanja! Go out and play!
I don 't want to!
It seems the girl liked me. She thought they beat me up because of her. ln fact they beat me up because I was different.
I don 't want to Iive here! They beat me up! What' s wrong?
Caterina! Are you there? Come and see what your son has done!
What a mess!
You shouldn 't have rented it to them, with a child!
That 's not a rag, it' s a towel! Sorry.
Hey, asshole, come out here!
Listen! Is this your son who 's been hitting these kids with a stick? He' s crazy!
He throws rocks!
Little brat!
If you touch him again, I 'm going to smash your face in!
Are these the guys who beat you up? Did you defend yourself?
Did he beat you up? And you?
Punch him.
I said hit him! Come on!
Again!
Hit him again!
On the nose, in his face! Pound him!
Okay, okay.
Now calm down. We 're Ieaving.
I should whip you. You flooded the whole house!
Sit down!
Get me the belt.
Give it to me, I said!
I forgive you.
Don 't worry, I' m going to beat him. Why do you want to hit him? It 's better to teach him the accordion.
Look at her!
Touch it.
Harder.
Understand?
And this?
It 's to scare people. lf you scare them, they respect you and they Iisten to you. - And if they don' t Iisten? = Pummel them.
And if they 're stronger than you? Whoever it is, you have to teII yourself: "I' m ready to kiII for this cigarette, for this ice cream."
Is that Stalin?
Why?
He 's my father.
Sure.
Really? Sure.
And he... does he know? Yes. But it 's a secret.
Don 't teII anyone, understand?
- Yes. = It 's a secret then, squirt.
I hope it 's okay...
FeeI how my heart is beating.
And you? Are you happy now? Go teII the neighbors you 're sorry before they throw us out.
Go, Sanja.
Do you have kids? We had them. We aII had children once:
Where did they go? Did they die in the war?
Yes.
Look, the sole has worn away. They 're old shoes. Not Iike your father' s... made of calfskin, new.
He 's not my father. - So who is he? - Uncle WatchamacaIlit!
You 're an idiot! You could have Iooked at his passport at Ieast. And what would I have done with it?
Good morning, lovely Iadies.
Please, help yourselves.
Aunt Tanja, have one.
= What Iuxury! What do we owe = - - We have to celebrate. Speaking of which, how do we want to celebrate?
To each his own.
It 's better to celebrate together!
I 'Il be in charge of organizing it.
- And don 't cry, Aunt Tanja. = I' II bring our daily bread!
No. no. - None for her. - No way.
Comrades... as a soldier, I traveI a Iot and meet a Iot of people. But I have never met people... as kind and friendly as you. For this reason... accept as a sign of gratitude... tickets for the circus!
For Saturday! We 'II go together. You' re crazy to spend so much!
We are touched, reaIly. We 'd love to come. EspeciaIly on Saturday!
To your health.
Why are we sitting? You men could ask us to dance.
May I?
- I can 't come to the circus. = Why not? I have a play on Saturday. And then?
Some Iike to meddle in other people 's affairs.
David Solomonich, a toast.
I would Iike to toast... the man who made this day possible... and not just this. To the good, the wise... the best of aII men. To Comrade Stalin.
I also have to drink to his honor.
What is this stuff?
Water!
I know you too weIl. I 've lived with you too Iong!
Know what I think? When you 're big, you' re going to marry me.
Nice. huh!
What time does Olga usuaIly come home?
It depends.
I understand.
Saniec 'ka, I have to go out for a minute. Don' t go. Please, don 't go away.
You promised me we would go back.
- I 'm not coming! - Be good!
You 're a liar!
Sasha. maybe we have to Ieave. = Right now? And Uncle Toljan? - I don 't know.
- What did you come here for? - To get my things.
I 'm Ieaving.
So take your things then. You knew it, right?
What are you doing?
But what... What are you Iooking for?
What are you doing? I don 't understand!
= Where is your Olga? - What fucking Olga?
Get the boy, otherwise we 'lI miss our train.
- So then you 're not a soldier. - I am, actuaIly.
They stick my rank on my ass, and they even give me a title!
And I thought that now... we would Iive together. I love you. And you...
- I did it for the boy too...
- TelI me about it Iater!
Let 's go. - Don' t take anything. Iet 's go. = What?
I love you. We have a child to raise... C 'mon, we' II miss our train.
Let 's go, the train' s Ieaving.
Think about it later. Now Iet 's go. No!
Then Ieave me the address. Maybe I 'II write you from prison. You know
I have no address.
C 'mon. squirt. Here you go, chief. AII set.
= Did you Iook at it? = AII set.
- Mommy. = Be quiet.
Mommy. Iook!
This is mine! Give it to me! Give it to me, I said!
Be quiet.
Leave them alone. If they ask, it 's not our stuff.
Would you Iike tea?
Everything 's fine, Katiusha! Now we can enjoy ourselves!
Oh, my sweetheart I love you so Listen to my love song
I hate you!
Take it.
Never, ever. You 'II take it and then tomorrow you' Il go to the market and seIl it. Me?
Here!
And so I saw the Black Sea for the first time.
Good morning, comrades.
Who 's in charge here?
My wife and son are down there.
Comrade Captain!
- Comrade Captain! - C 'mon, Iet' s go...
Put the bags in the Ieft Iuggage. Hurry!
It would have been better if you hadn 't come back. Liar.
"Shipr."
- What? - Shipr cologne.
= We 'd Iike to rent a room. - We' re no trouble. My husband is in the service, my son is weIl = behaved.
Yes, I understand, but... we don 't rent.
Too bad.
But there 's a coIlective apartment in the basement. I think they rent there.
Katja.
Are you sleeping?
No. What 's wrong?
What 's wrong with her?
Bring her some water.
= Stop! You new here? - Yes!
Are you a new tenant?
What 's wrong, Katja?
I 'm scared, Toljan.
What do I do with it?
Drink it. ActuaIly, go out and check things out. Take a good Iook, then teII me.
What 's wrong with that? Sanja, want to become a soldier? Yes.
You promised it was the last time... and then we would have a normaI Iife!
You were the one who said you 'd write me from jaiI! If I keep going like this, I' lI end up Iike you. And who wiII I send postcards to?
I 'II kiII you!
Go ahead.
You know the rules of the game?
If you puII a knife, you have to use it.
Go ahead. Otherwise I 'II hit you.
Leave me alone!
Sanja, are you in there?
Stay in there. it 's good for you!
Citizens!
Do you have an accordion? The souI needs music.
Do you have an accordion? Good idea, putting the bed between two night tables!
WiII you avenge me, my son?
Daddy!
C 'mon, Comrade, play.
The night is short.
At Ieast teII us why we 're celebrating. ReaIly, Anatolij, please teII us. It' s my birthday.
Citizens... this is what I want to say:
I Iiked you right from the start. Iike a family. - And for this reason - - - There 'II be no circus.
For this reason...
I want to drink with you to Comrade Stalin.

Stop it!
Documents for you, shithead? Here! I should show them to him!
Go to heII! We 're just wasting time. That' s it, good boys, go on.

You just have to open the door.

Sanja! Are you wetting yourself? Are you a Iittle girl?
There 's no time. squirt.
Don 't be afraid or we' II faIl. I 'm not going up. We' re Iike thieves.
Did you sleep too little or eat too much, squirt? What thieves?
= You know who my father fights? - Which father? Stalin?
A spy?
I 'm on a mission, and you' re ruining everything. Are you an accomplice? I 'm not an accomplice.
Prove you 're a reaI Soviet! But I have to pee. Hold it in!

Shake it! Harder!
You have to do it, or I won 't be able to puII you out! Push!
You 're a weakling. squirt!
Push, or they 'II shoot you! I can' t! Push, I said.
Push!
I 'm going to see where he is.
Citizen, I can 't see through you. Sit down.
= Thanks for Iooking after it for me. = No problem.
Where 's my son? His father took him with him. He said to go straight to the station and wait for him there.
Hey! What are you doing up there?
What 's your problem. Savel' evna? Someone must have entered from the doctor 's window.
The windows are dark. There 's no one home. Savel' evna, everyone 's asleep.
It 's open here.
I 'm caIling the police. They' II take care of it.
Is this her? Get in!
- Hurry! Let 's go! - Where' s Sanja?
C 'mon, Iet' s go!
This time it was a fiasco.
Why did you take the boy with you? Just because. And then I didn 't know how it' d go with the madame.
We 're going to the Molotovka stop. No one wiII find us there. We' II take the train.
I 'm going to Ieave you, Toljan.
This time, I 'm reaIly going to. Where?
To Ivanovo. I hear they need workers there. Then go.
Maybe you 'II find someone better.
Maybe... But I won 't love him Iike you.
Here 's the ticket. One seat, me and the boy.
Seat 15.
Enough. Go on.
Maybe they 'II give room and board at Ivanovo. - The boy' lI go to school. If you - = - Katja, don 't start.
I Iike the Iife I Iive. I don 't want another one.
Take these to help you get started.
Did you buy these for me at the market as weIl?
So, squirt. Even you want to Ieave me?
I have your gun in my suitcase. Keep it. I don 't need it.
Get on!
Go on.
- Sanja! - Where are you going? - Sanja!
Freeze!
Stop or I 'II shoot!
Shoot, he 's getting away! Stop!
- What did he do to you? = He threw salt at me!
The suitcase!
= So why did he escape? - He ran after the boy. = So why did he escape? - He ran after the boy.
How can you leave a boy without his father? I 'm not moved by whimpering or by kids. The sergeant has two.
Maybe we can help his family out. I have a ring and some earrings. Would you Iet him go?
I don 't know. After my shift, I' m going to see... the sergeant in the hospital. - I can try to...
- I 'II be right back.
= Right away! = Hurry up! I 'm not going to wait aII night.
- Give them to me. - What? Where are they?
- Here? - I don 't remember!
Look for them, Sanja! I 'm asking you in the name of God!
We 'II surely find them. We have to! Where could they have gone?
He Ieft.
One moment, citizen. I don 't understand. You want to bribe me?
Me? Bribe me? I 'II send you to Siberia... to cut down trees.
At Ieast let me see my husband. They 've taken him to the city, to Molotovskoe. Look for him there.
Our efforts were in vain.
They didn 't find out about the burglaries in the apartments... but they gave him seven years anyway.
We waited in front of the prison... to see him before the long separation. My mother didn 't know it would be her last time. - Do you know when they caII them?
My son, my son... If you hadn 't run away... he would be with us now.
Everyone back! If anyone moves. I 'II shoot!
Mommy, what does this mean?
Number one! Keep your head down!
Number two! Keep your head down!
Vanja! Vanja! I 'm here!
Pasha!
Serozha! Nina had a baby! What is it?
It 's a girl! Back! Micola!
Keep your head down! Toljan!
Sanja! Daddy! Don 't Ieave us alone!
Daddy!
Don 't Ieave us alone!
From that day on... I never saw the image of the soldier... of my real father again. Maybe because on that day...
Come with me.
My Iittle boy.
Mom, what 's wrong?
TeII her to give you mine too.
Mom, what are you saying?
Does it hurt? What operation is it? They talk about an operation, but I don 't understand.
That 's aIl. Nothing very good. Get weII soon.
Mom, sing me our Iittle song.
Not now, I 'm tired. It was the "Three Witnesses".
My mother died of peritonitis... after a botched abortion. I heard some of what the doctors said... but then I couldn 't understand any of the details... and they weren' t important.
From that moment on I had no one else in the world... closer than Tol jan.
My mother 's watch and the gun... were the only things left from that life. Fortunately I was able to hide the gun. I hid it often, later... in the orphanage.
For years, I lived with the dream that Tol jan was free... and he would take me away with him.
Chigariov, straighten your back!
Grab the handlebar. Let 's go!
Faster. hurry!
Let 's go!
Bastards! Idiots!
What are you doing, boy? You seIling a handlebar?
Squirt.
You Iooking for someone?
You. Me?
Why is that?
I 'm Sanja.
So? I 'm Katja' s son. Do you remember Katja?
Which Katja? On the train, with the Iittle boy. Wait, wait.
- Right, Sanja! - Toljan! You 're a reaI piece of work!
You had a kid with Katja and you don 't even remember! Oh shut up!
So... squirt... what do you want? - You want money? - For who?
Katja, he says... C 'mon, I fucked one... on the train, that' s aIl. TeII her I 'm not your father. squirt!
You telI her! Look, Iook. She 's jealous.
I 've faIlen in love with this one... Iike a Iittle boy.
Go to your damn Katja and take your friends with you!
Good times...
TeII your mother I said heIlo.
TeII her "From Toljan".
She 'II remember.
Now go on.
And so I was left all alone in the world.
I felt nothing. I only had the feeling he had betrayed me and my mother... and that I had to kill him. I didn 't want to be like him anymore.
Yet my life didn 't become easier.
So I decided to start up a new life... not to think of him anymore. He didn 't exist.
He had never existed. He didn 't even exist in my dreams.
Nothing existed. Nothing... nothing... nothing.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy! Don 't Ieave us alone!
Daddy!

A woman was robbed. People.
Stay in your seat. - I 'm going, you slay here. - Mom, please!
Listen, squirt. Here you go. What are you doing?
Keep an eye on my stuff, okay?
Excuse me.
Excuse me, let us through.
Why cry? It 's too late.
Shall we have a smoke?
Are you crazy! What 's your name? Mine?
Katja.
Daddy!
Where are you going?
Well... I don 't know.
We got off with Uncle Toljan in some random city. My mom said that from then on we would live with him... and that I would have to call him Dad.
We walked through the city... looking for a room or a small apartment to rent.
Do you have a room?
The accountant and his wife live there. An engineer and his daughter, there Here 's the kitchen.
The bathroom.
An artist lives here, my husband and I there.
Varvara teaches the accordion there.
A drunk woman lives in there, but she 's harmless.
The room isn 't mine, it' s my sister Anna 's. She' s in the hospital now.
And I 'm Aunt Tanja.
Sanjec 'ka.
Aunt Tanja.
I 'll give you the down payment in a few days. My housing money and passport are at the military headquarters. You know how the army is.
Okay. Whenever. You 're a father, a soldier.
Mommy!
What 's wrong? Calm down.
It 's nothing, honey.
- What 's wrong, Sanja? - It' s nothing. He 'll go back to sleep now.
What are you saying?
I heard it, you know?
You were dreaming.
I 'm sleeping here!
Not on your life!
Lie down here.
I 'm staying with mommy.
Goddammit! I sleep here. If you say another word, I 'll throw you out the window!
So?
Don 't worry.
Put a nail up.
Why? To hang up your uniform.
Okay, I 'll put it up myself.
And what are these? They 're for you, I bought them at the market.
Just for me? For you, for you.
For me?
It 's for me?
It doesn 't fit.
Stop it.
Stop it, get out.
And don 't make any noise, or they' ll send us away.
Your passport isn 't at headquarters. You never went there. I' m on leave.
You 're Sasha?
My name is Inessa Pavlovna.
Are you the drunk? No.
- I haven 't had a drink in a month. - Sanja! Go out and play!
I don 't want to!
It seems the girl liked me. She thought they beat me up because of her. In fact they beat me up because I was different.
I don’t want to live here! They beat me up! What 's wrong?
Caterina! Are you there? Come and see what your son has done!
What a mess!
You shouldn 't have rented it to them, with a child!
That 's not a rag it' s a towel! Sorry.
Hey, asshole, come out here!
Listen! Is this your son who 's been hitting these kids with a stick? He' s crazy!
He throws rocks!
Little brat!
If you touch him again, I 'm going to smash your face in!
Are these the guys who beat you up? Did you defend yourself?
Did he beat you up '! And you?
Punch him.
I said hit him! Come on!
Again!
Hit him again!
On the nose, in his face! Pound him!
Okay, okay.
Now calm down. We 're leaving.
I should whip you. You flooded the whole house!
Sit down!
Get me the belt.
Give it to me, I said!
I forgive you.
Don 't worry, I' m going to beat him. Why do you want to hit him? It 's better to teach him the accordion.
Look at her!
Touch it.
Harder.
Understand?
And this?
It 's to scare people. It you scare them, they respect you and they listen to you. - And it they don' t listen '!
And if they 're stronger than you? Whoever it is, you have to tell yourself: “I' m ready to kill for this cigarette, for this ice cream. "The others understand that, and they will give you anything.
Is that Stalin?
Why?
He 's my father.
Sure.
Really? Sure.
And he... does he know? Yes. But it 's a secret.
Don 't tell anyone, understand?
- Yes. - It 's a secret then, squirt.
I hope it 's okay...
Feel how my heart is beating.
And you? Are you happy now? Go tell the neighbors you 're sorry before they throw us out.
Go, Sanja.
Do you have kids? We had them. We all had children once:
Where did they go? Did they die in the war?
Yes.
Look, the sole has worn away. They 're old shoes. Not like your father' s... made of calfskin, new.
He 's not my father. - So who is he? - Uncle Whatchamacallit!
You 're an idiot! You could have looked at his passport at least. And what would I have done with it?
Good morning, lovely ladies.
Please, help yourselves.
Aunt Tania, have one.
- What luxury! What do we owe - - - We have lo celebrate. Speaking of which, how do we want to celebrate?
To each his own.
It 's better to celebrate together!
I 'll be in charge of organizing it.
- And don 't cry, Aunt Tania - I' ll bring our daily bread!
No, no. - None for her. - No way.
Comrades... as a soldier, I travel a lot and meet a lot of people. But I have never met people... as kind and friendly as you. For this reason... accept as a sign of gratitude... tickets for the circus!
For Saturday! We 'll go together. You' re crazy to spend so much!
We are touched, really. We 'd love to come. Especially on Saturday!
To your health.
Why are we sitting? You men could ask us to dance.
May I?
I can 't come to the circus. Why not? I have a play on Saturday.
Some like to meddle in other people 's affairs.
David Solomonich, a toast
I would like to toast... the man who made this day possible... and not just this. To the good, the wise... the best of all men. To Comrade Stalin.
I also have to drink to his honor.
What is this stuff?
Water!
I know you too well. I 've lived with you too long!
Know what I think? When you 're big, you' re going to marry me.
Nice, huh!
What time does Olga usually come home?
It depends.
I understand.
Saniec 'ka, I have to go out for a minute. Don' t go. Please, don 't go away.
You promised me we would go back
- I 'm not coming! - Be good!
You 're a liar!
Sasha, maybe we have to leave. - Right now? And Uncle Toljan?
- What did you come here for? - To get my things.
To get my things.
So take your things then. You knew it, right?
What are you doing?
But what... What are you looking (or?
What are you doing? I don 't understand!
- Where is your Olga? - What fucking Olga?
Get the boy, otherwise we 'll miss our train.
- So then you 're not a soldier. - I am, actually.
They stick my rank on my ass, and they even give me a title!
And I thought that now... we would live together. I love you. And you...
- I did it for the boy too...
- Tell me about it later!
Let 's go. - Don' t take anything, let 's go. - What?
I love you. We have a child 10 raise... C 'mon, we' ll miss our train.
Let 's go, the train' s leaving.
Think about it later. Now let 's go. No!
Then leave me the address. Maybe I 'll write you from prison. You know
I have no address.
C 'mon, squirt. Here you go, chief. All set.
- Did you look at it? - All set.
- Mommy. - Be quiet.
Mommy, look!
This is mine! Give it to me! Give it to me, I said!
Be quiet.
Leave them alone. If they ask, it 's not our stuff.
Would you like tea?
Everything 's fine, Katiusha! Now we can enjoy ourselves!
Oh, my sweetheart I love you so Listen to my love song
I hate you!
Take it.
Never, ever. You 'll take it and then tomorrow you' ll go to the market and sell it. Me?
Here!
And so I saw the Black Sea for the first time.
Good morning, comrades.
Who 's in charge here?
My wife and son are down there.
Comrade Captain!
- Comrade Captain! - C 'mon, let' s go...
Put the bags in the left luggage. Hurry!
It would have been better if you hadn 't come back. Liar!
"Shipr."
- What? - Shipr cologne.
- We 'd like to rent a room - We' re no trouble. My husband is in the service, my son is well - behaved.
Yes, I understand, but... we don 't rent.
Too bad.
But there 's a collective apartment in the basement. I think they rent there.
Katja.
Are you sleeping?
No. What 's wrong?
What 's wrong with her?
Bring her some water.
- Stop! You new here '! - Yes!
Are you a new tenant?
Yes. - Don 't you say hello? - Hello.
What 's wrong, Katia?
I 'm scared, Toljan.
What do I do with it?
Drink it. Actually, go out and check things out. Take a good look, then tell me.
What 's wrong with that? Sanja, want to become a soldier? Yes.
You promised it was the last time... and then we would have a normal life!
You were the one who said you 'd write me from jail! If I keep going like this I' ll end up like you. And who will I send postcards to?
I 'll kill you!
Go ahead.
You know the rules of the game?
If you pull a knife, you have to use ii.
Go ahead. Otherwise I 'll hit you.
Leave me alone!
Sanja, are you in there?
Stay in there, it’s good for you!
Citizens!
Do you have an accordion? The soul needs music.
Do you have an accordion? Good idea, putting the bed between two night tables!
Will you avenge me, my son?
Daddy!
C 'mon, Comrade, play.
The night is short.
At least tell us why we 're celebrating. Really, Anatolij, please tell us.
Citizens... this is what I want to say:
I liked you right from the start, like a family. - And for this reason...
- There 'll be no circus.
For this reason...
I want to drink with you to Comrade Stalin.
Hello.

You 're not any trouble.
Give me your hand.
We 'll clean it up.
Does it hurt?
Does it burn? You have to disinfect it, otherwise you could get tetanus.

You had a kid with Katia and you don’t even remember! Oh shut up!
So... squirt... what do you want? - You want money? - For who?
Katja, he says... C 'mon, I lucked one... on the train, that' s all. Tell her I 'm not your father, squirt!
You tell her! Look, look. She 's jealous.
I 've fallen in love with this one... like a little boy.
Go to your damn Katja and take your friends with you!
Good times...
Tell your mother I said hello.
Tell her "From Toljan".
She 'll remember.
Now go on.
And so I was left all alone in the world.
I felt nothing. I only had the feeling he had betrayed me and my mother... and that I had to kill him. I didn’t want to be like him anymore.
Yet my life didn’t become easier.
So I decided to start up a new life... not to think of him anymore. He didn 't exist.
He had never existed. He didn’t even exist in my dreams.
Nothing existed. Nothing... nothing... nothing.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy! Don 't leave us alone!
Daddy!

Peter.
You could not watch even one hour with me? Master, what has happened to you? Should I call the others, Lord?
What is wrong with him? He seems afraid. He had spoken about danger while we ate...
Thirty. Thirty, Judas. That was the agreement between me... and you?
Where?
Where is he?
Hear me, Father.
Rise up, defend me.
Save me from the traps they set for me.
Do you really believe...... that one man can bear...... the full burden of sin? Shelter me, O Lord.
I trust in You.
In You I take refuge.
No one man can carry this burden...... I tell you. It is far too heavy. Saving their souls is too costly.
No.
Never.
Father, you can do all things.
If it is possible, let this chalice pass from me...
But let Your will be done...... not mine.
Who is your father?
Who are you?
Who are you looking for?
We 're looking for Jesus of Nazareth.
I am he.
Hail, Rabbi!
Judas...... you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?
Peter!
Put it down!
Those who live by the sword shall die by the sword.
Put it down.
Malchus! Get up! We 've got him.
What, Mary? What is it?
Listen... "Why is this night different from every other night?"
"Because once we were slaves...
"... and we are slaves no longer..."
They 've seized him!
Everyone you can, hear? To the courtyard of the High Priest. Quick!
Halt! Not so fast.
This is not your party, you toothless vermin.
Peter...
Hey! What 's going on here? In there!
Jesus. Jesus of Nazareth! Shut up!
She 's crazy. A criminal. Brought in for questioning, that' s all.
Broke the temple laws.
I see.
Better go tell him there 's more trouble brewing. Tell who?
Abenader, you idiot. Get going!
Go!
Jesus...
Are you hungry?
Yes, I am.
This is certainly a tall table!
Who is it for? A rich man.
Does he like to eat standing up?
No. He prefers to eat like... so.
Tall table, tall chairs! Well, I haven 't made them yet.
This will never catch on!
Oh, no you don 't! Take off that dirty apron before you come in.
And wash your hands.
It has begun, Lord.
So be it.
Sir, there 's trouble at... What, in the middle of the night, Abenader? I' m sorry.
Some Galilean. The Pharisees apparently hate the man. A Galilean?
Who is this beggar you bring to us...... chained up like a condemned man? He 's Jesus, the Nazarene troublemaker.
You 're Jesus of Nazareth?
They say you 're a king. Where is this kingdom of yours? What line of kings do you descend from?
You 're just the son of some obscure carpenter, no?
Some say you 're Elijah. But he was carried off to heaven in a chariot!
Why don 't you say something? You' ve been brought here as a blasphemer!
What do you say to that? Defend yourself.
I have spoken openly to everyone. I 've taught...... in the temple where we all gather. Ask those who have heard what I have to say.
If I have spoken evil...... tell me what evil I have said.
But if not, why do you hit me?
Yes, we 'll listen to those who heard your blasphemies.
Good!
Let 's hear them. He cures the sick by magic!
With the help of devils!
I 've seen it.
He casts out devils, with the help of devils.
He calls himself the king of the Jews!
No, he calls himself the son of God! He said he would destroy the temple...... and rebuild it in three days!
Worse! He claims he 's the bread of life! And if we don' t eat his flesh or drink his blood...... we won 't inherit eternal life.
You 're all under this man' s spell. Either offer proof of his wrongdoing...... or be quiet! This entire proceeding is an outrage.
Who called this meeting anyway? And at this hour of the night? Where are the other members of the council?
Get out! A travesty! That 's what this is, a beastly travesty!
Haven 't you anything to say? No answer to these accusations?
I ask you now...... Jesus of Nazareth... Tell us, are you the Messiah?
The son of the living God?
I AM...... and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of power...... and coming on the clouds of heaven.
Blasphemy!
You heard him. There 's no need for witnesses!
Your verdict. What is your verdict?
Death!
Haven 't I seen you in the company of the Galilean? Yes! You' re one of his disciples!
I don 't know the man! You are wrong!
Stop! Stop! I 've seen you before!
You 're wrong, damn you! I swear I don' t know the man. I 've never seen him before.
Wherever you go, Lord...... I will follow.
To prison, even to death.
Amen, I say to you...... before the cock crows...... three times you will deny me.
Peter?
No, no... I am unworthy!
I have denied him, Mother!
Denied him three times.
Let 's go! You take care of it.
Let him pass. He 's harmless.
Release him!
Take back the silver. Here!
I 've sinned, betrayed innocent blood.
Take back your silver. I don 't want it! If you think you' ve betrayed innocent blood, that 's your affair.
Take your money and go.
Now go!
What 's wrong? Are you all right? Look at his mouth.
He 's bleeding! Look! Blood!
Leave me alone...... you little satans!
Aha! Cursing! Are you cursed?
Watch out, it 's like burning oil from his bones!
Get away from me! Leave me alone!
Don 't condemn this Galilean. He' s holy. You will only bring trouble on yourself.
Do you always punish your prisoners before they 're judged? Governor... What accusations do you bring against this man?
Well... If he weren 't a malefactor, we wouldn' t have brought him before you. That 's not what I asked.
Go on... He has seduced the people...... taught foul, disgusting doctrines.
Isn 't he the prophet you welcomed into Jerusalem only five days ago? And now you want him dead? Can any of you explain this madness to me?
Your Excellency, please... So far the high priest hasn 't told you this man' s greatest crime.
He has become the leader of a large and dangerous sect...... who hail him as the Son of David!
He claims that he is the Messiah...... the king promised to the Jews.
He has forbidden his followers to pay tribute to the emperor, Consul!
Bring him here!
Go!
Drink.
Are you the king of the Jews?
Does this question come from you? Or do you ask me this because others have told you that is what I am?
Why would I ask you that? Am I a Jew? Your high priests, your own people delivered you up to me.
Are you a king?
My kingdom is not of this world. If it were...... do you think my followers would have let them hand me over?
Then you are a king?
That is why I was born. To give testimony to the truth. All men who hear the truth hear my voice.
Truth!
What is truth?
I have questioned this prisoner, and I find no cause in him.
This man is a Galilean, is he not?
He is. Then he is King Herod 's subject.
Let Herod judge him. Governor... Hand him over.
Jesus of Nazareth! Where?
Where is he?
This...... is Jesus of Nazareth?
Is it true that you restore sight to the blind?
Raise men from the dead?
Where do you get your power?
Are you the one whose birth was foretold?
Answer me! Are you a king?
How about me?
Will you work a little miracle for me?
Take this stupid fool out of my sight. He 's not guilty of a crime, he' s just crazy.
Give him a fool 's homage...
What is truth, Claudia? Do you hear it, recognize it when it is spoken? Yes, I do.
Don 't you? How? Can you tell me?
If you will not hear the truth, no one can tell you.
Truth... Do you want to know what my truth is, Claudia?
I 've been putting down rebellions in this rotten outpost for eleven years. If I don' t condemn this man...... I know Caiphas will start a rebellion. If I do condemn him, then his followers may.
Either way, there will be bloodshed. Caesar has warned me, Claudia. Warned me twice.
Herod refuses to condemn the man. They 're bringing him back here. We' re going to need reinforcements.
There is already an uprising.
King Herod found no cause in this man.
Neither do I.
Men! Attend to the crowd!
Quiet! Have you no respect for our Roman procurator?
As you know, every year I release a criminal back to you. We are now holding a notorious murderer...... Barabbas.
Which of the two men would you have me release to you? The murderer Barabbas? Or Jesus, called the Messiah?
Free Barabbas!
Again I ask you: Which of these two men should I release to you? Free Barabbas!
Free him.
What would you have me do with Jesus the Nazarene?
Have him crucified!
No! I will chastise him...... but then I will set him free.
See to it that the punishment is severe, Abenader. But don 't let them kill the man.
My heart is ready, Father...... my heart is ready.
My son...... when, where, how...... will you choose to be delivered of this?
If the world hates you...... remember that it has hated me first.
Remember also that no servant is greater than his master.
If they persecuted me, they will persecute you.
You must not be afraid. The Helper will come...... who reveals the truth about God...... and who comes from the Father.
Stop!
Enough! Your orders were to punish this man...
... not to scourge him to death!
Take him away.
Get going!
Get him out of here!
Your majesty... Take care of it. A beautiful rose bush.
Look at him... king of the worms!
Hail, wormy king!
A color fit for a king!
We 're here to pay our respects.
A leader for our brotherhood!
Behold the man.
Crucify him!
Isn 't this enough? Look at him! Crucify him!
Shall I crucify your king?
We have no king but Caesar!
Speak to me. I have the power to crucify you, or else to set you free.
You have no power over me...... except what is given you from above.
Therefore, it is he who delivered me to you...... who has the greater sin.
If you free him, Governor...... you are no friend of Caesar 's.
You must crucify him!
It is you who want to crucify him, not I. Look you to it. I am innocent of this man 's blood.
Abenader...
Do as they wish.
I am your servant, Father. Your servant, and the son of Your handmaid. Why do you embrace your cross, fool?
All right, your highness, let 's move!
Help me get near him.
This way.
This way, Mother.
Mother...
Mother...
I 'm here...
I 'm here...
See, mother, I make all things new.
Who is that? Who?
She 's the Galilean' s mother. Let 's go.
Come on!
Don 't fret, my daughter. Don' t fret.
Are you blind?
Can 't you see, he can' t go on?
Help him!
You! Yes, you! Get over here!
What do you want from me? This criminal can 't carry his cross by himself anymore. You will help him!
I can 't do that. It' s none of my business. Get someone else!
All right, but remember...... l 'm an innocent man, forced to carry the cross of a condemned man.
Stay here. Wait for me.
Permit me, my Lord.
Who do you think you are? Get away from here.
Impossible people!
Someone stop this!
Stop! Stop!
Leave him alone!
If you don 't stop, I won' t carry that cross one more step. I don 't care what you do to me!
All right, all right, let 's get moving. We don' t have all day. Let 's go!
Let 's go...... Jew!
Almost there.
We 're nearly there.
Almost done.
You have heard it said...... you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
But I say to you...... love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you... For if you love only those who love you...
... what reward is there in that?
I am the good shepherd.
I lay down my life for my sheep. No one takes my life from me...... but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down...... and power to take it up again.
This command is from my Father.
Get away now, you 're free to go. Go on! Go on!
You can get up now!
Get up, your majesty. Can 't you get up?
We haven 't got all day.
Come on, move! We 're ready. Get up, your highness.
You are my friends.
There is no greater love than for a man to lay down his life for his friends.
I cannot be with you much longer, my friends. You cannot go where I am going. My commandment to you after I am gone is this...
You believe in me.
You know that I am the Way...... the Truth, and the Life.
And no one comes to the Father but by me.
Further out...
Idiots! Let me show you how to do it. Like this!
There! No, get in there. Hold the hand open like this.
Father...... Father my Father... my God...
They don 't know... they don' t know...
Stupid mongrels! Turn the wood over on its face, idiots!
Take this and eat. This is my body which is given up for you.
Take this and drink.
This is my blood of the new covenant...... which is given for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.
If you are the son of God, why don 't you save yourself?
Prove to us...... you are who you say you are.
You said you could destroy the temple...... and rebuild it in three days...... and yet you cannot come down from that cross. If he is the Messiah...... I say let him come down from the cross...... so that we may see and believe.
Father, forgive them...... they know not what they do.
Listen...... he prays for you.
We deserve this, Gesmas...... but he does not.
I have sinned...... and my punishment is just.
You would be justified in condemning me.
I ask only that you remember me, Lord...... when you enter your kingdom.
Amen, I tell you...
... on this day you shall be with me...
... in paradise.
I thirst.
Flesh of my flesh...... heart of my heart... My son, let me die with you.
Woman...... behold your son.
Son, behold...
... your mother.
There is no one left.
No one, Jesus!
My God...
... why have you forsaken me?
It is accomplished.
Father, into your hands...... I commend... my spirit.
Cassius! Hurry! He 's dead!
Make sure!
Subtitles Provided By Worldwide7477 Okay, settle down. Got your ears open?
A long, long time ago, in a land far, far away...... there lived a warrior. A warrior with empty eyes.
He 'd trained his entire life for one purpose...... to be the greatest swordsman in the history of mankind.
He just achieved his life 's ambition, but his heart felt emptier than ever.
These two clans had been warring for 500 years. And they vowed to keep on warring...... until one of them didn 't have a single man left above Styx.
And so now, here he was, peering down...... at this very last of his enemy.
When that little warrior princess giggled...... it did something to him inside. But this was no time for feeling.
For when he spared that baby 's life...... he put his name at the top of his own clan' s death list.
With nothing but the clothes on his back...... and the baby in his arms...... he decided to pay a visit to an old warrior friend in a faraway land.
Hey, Johnny...... I don 't like your stinking face. Easy, Ronald.
The name 's Eight - Ball, like in the game. Good luck for some, bad luck for others. How can I assist you, my friend from the mystical East?
Haven 't been here since Smiley kicked the bucket. Was a three - day wait just to get your shirts pressed.
For a guy who cleaned sheets all day...... he sure liked to make a mess in the afterhours, if you know what I mean.
See you in the morning.
You came to me to be strong.
I have made you the strongest. She will always be the enemy.
Here it is. Just rub some on your shoulder.
Smiley 's Oriental Cure - All. Works like a charm.
Oh, now, honey, I didn 't forget about you.
It 's all right there. It' s all right.
Sorry about the tap I gave you. I thought you knew the sword. Smiley was always yabbering on about a guy who was gonna roll into town.
She 's not yours? Where' s her folks? Dead.
Best we find you another diaper. All right.
Smiley, like, your uncle or something? Friend. Well, if you were his friend...... maybe he would like for you to take over his laundry.
You on the 40. All right now, time to get to work.
You 're slower than molasses in January.
You clean that real good, yellow boy. As clean as Snow White 's panties. If I find the smallest bit of condor crap on my fancy duds...... well, we gonna have us - -
-... we were just having us some fun. - Really?
Okay, okay. Let go.
Get out of here.
How about a home - cooked meal for you and your little 'un?
Once that Ferris wheel is finished, it 's gonna bring everybody rushing back. And then we can take the word "travelling" out of "travelling circus." Hey, Ron.
Bravo, bravo.
- Gonna grab some vittles with us? - No, thanks. I 'm not hungry.
We baked a cake.
Come on, Ron. What the hell 's up with her?
You. I knew you was trouble the moment you walked into this - -
Sounds even better from inside.
You ever seen one of these before?
The sound it 's making...... it' s called "opera." The day my papa found his first chunk of gold, he went out and bought this.
Listen. Here 's my favourite part.
So at the edge of the desert...... in a busted town full of broken people...... the warrior began to learn stuff he should 've learned a long time ago.
No, no. Rough.
Like the joy of getting dirty things clean.
Yes.
That 's me. Thank you. I told you to aim at the line, not at the coin.
He learned you could be happy working with folks. And finding the simple peace in some private time...... after a hard day 's work. What' s taking you so long?
Come on, Skinny. You 're gonna miss it. Come on.
And he found that it 's nice to have a few friends around...... when the sun goes down.
But most of all, the warrior learned...... there 's a heck of a lot more pleasure making things grow...... than there is in cutting them down.
- Let me see that. - Chuck it here. You bunch of pups, give me that there goddamned bottle.
- Over here. I got it. - Who you think you 're playing with?
Over here.
You win. Show me what you got.
Goddamn, I should 've never taught you this game. You a shark with a poker face.
What happened to her?
Please. Help me.
- Help me. - Lynne! Please.
Hungry?
No?
Pretty thing.
Damn you!
No!
No! Lynne! Lynne!
No!
No - -!
Only thing was, when we went to bury her, she was still breathing. Never known nobody that close to kicking it. We didn 't know what to do with her.
Dang it. My arm ain 't worth a damn.
It is not your arm.
What 'd you say?
Are you sure about this? Because I 'm not so good with my eyes open. Throw.
- I can 't do it. - Do not talk. Focus.
- You dead? - Not yet.
Sure you 're not fountaining blood or anything, are you?
Oh, shit.
I did it.
Thank you, Mr. Sad Flute.
Smiley told me everything. I just taught you to focus.
Why you do that?
Okay. I 've always been dying to know. Why you all called the Sad Flutes?
So you got lady Sad Flutes, too? Sad Flutinas or something?
Yes.
That 's nice. Jumping in the moonlight and kissing...... as you both fly under the stars to the tunes of the Sad Flutes - - We are called Sad Flutes...... because when you cut the throat, the last sound is like a sad flute.
Skinny, you sure know how to throw a dead oat into a party room, don 't you?
Why 'd you become a Sad Flute?
- To be strong. - That it?
My father was working in the field. I was helping him.
A swordsman came...... killed my father.
Just to test his sword.
That must 've hurt you something bad. Not hurt... Hang“! -
Here. Take it. It 's a present.
Kind of.
Present? Yeah.
That is your only friend here. Take good care of it. Yes, master.
- Tarnations. - Only to protect, not kill. What am I gonna kill in this town, armadillo?
Is that what I think it is?
You 've sealed it. So they cannot hear. Hear what?
Of all the souls I have taken.
Who 's listening? My past. And if it hears?
No more music.
This is a big country. Where do we look?
Do not look. We listen. He will show.
Think of the sword as part of the body. Like a finger. Like a tooth.
I 'd rather think of it like metal slicing through a herd of buffalo.
Show me what Smiley taught you.
You do not have the power. Well, thank you very much. I did not know that.
Just have to be faster.
What are you - -? Is this because of yesterday? I said I was sorry.
Cut it out, Skinny.
Stop it, Skinny. Cut it out. I 'm serious.
You bearded nut. You watch yourself.
Merry Christmas, laundry man. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
We go.
May I have this dance?
Whose birthday? Well, it 's sort of a long story.
Hey, hey, heV -
- Dance with us. - Hey, you fox.
You gonna take me for a spin or what?
I win. No. Until your enemy 's heart stops, you have not won.
Is that so?
Did that stop your heart?
That 's better.
Merry Christmas. I didn 't get my invitation. Has anyone seen it'?
No?
Never mind.
We 're all here now. No harm done.
And what did Santa bring you, little boy?
Why, if it ain 't a clown.
Looking so sad.
You know, I never found clowns that funny myself.
Don 't worry, clown. I' m a pretty good shot. Especially when I 've been drinking.
H9) '- Don' t go wasting good moonshine.
This shit 's smoother than a calf' s ass.
But this party 's for girls. Let' s all go to the saloon. What have we here?
Looks like we got ourselves another clown.
Take this clown for a walk.
Ride, ride, ride.
Never quite understood the attraction for the circus.
Till now.
Join the others in Stockton. I 'll catch you up.
Gentlemen, I have a few old memories I 'd like to revisit. Follow me.
Dang it! He killed my whole family!
Goddamn it, Baptiste, let me go or I swear I 'm gonna - - I' m sorry, Lynne. Lynne, this ain 't just for your protection, you know.
Let me see.
We have a winner. Gentlemen. Maria!
He 'vs your marido? MY apologies.
I am not the kind of man who sleeps with a married woman. No.
- MOmmy! 'MOmmy! No!
But her daughters. That 's a completely different matter.
Clean them up. You get a bullet in the head for every louse I find.
I once strung a man up by his own hamstrings...... because he cooked me a steak well - done.
What? Find that funny?
Or is it because of this?
Thank you, gentlemen. This girl says she 'll serve herself up to you instead of the spics.
Have we met before? No. We haven 't.
You have good teeth. I like that. Colonel, as you unwrap me...... I 'm sure you will find there' s a whole lot more of me to like.
Tell them to get. This ain 't the theatre. Gentlemen, you heard the lady.
Lynne.
She 's not here.
Now, I... I might say some things during... Feel free to answer if you like.
Nothing is too wrong.
I 've been waiting my whole life...... for a place where it' s right to be wrong.
You know...... I don 't think any part of the body is dirty or bad. Just as long as it' s well scrubbed.
Yes.
Assemble. Now.
Now, where do you plan to begin the inspection? I like where the skin creases. Go on.
The moment I smelt your neck, it all came flooding back.
No girl could ever smell as sweet.
You changed it all. My world. My face.
And now I 'm going to change yours.
That certainly is a beautiful scar I gave you.
A hard - on for a scar...... now, that is wrong.
I forgot...... nothing tonight is wrong.
Wrists.
Tell the cook to fry up some potatoes.
And while we 're waiting I thought I should give you...... what I was so generously offering 10 years ago.
Enjoy the show.
No. He 's mine.
Lynne.
Are you all right?
Cover me.
Hold on.
Lynne.
Did she kill him?
Pull it off.
- She got the wrong guy. - That ain 't him. Oh, God, help us.
Sweet mother of God, it 's a goddamn butcher shop in here. - What' s going on? - Let 's go look at this.
I must go, or you will all be in danger. We 're in danger already.
- Colonel 's on the loose. - That' s right. Lynne smoked the wrong guy.
H9) '- Beth will understand.
Follow me.
I ruined everything...... didn 't I?
You did what you had to do.
You could have just grabbed April and hit the trail...... but you didn 't.
Knowing saving me would ruin every new thing you found here.
This new world...... without you...... not so new.
Hey, let 's say somehow they all come and go and we' re still breathing.
You 're still gonna leave, right?
That is the plan.
Maybe I could go with you?
Just think about it, all right?
Hey. That 's my primo cactus juice.
I knew what you was from the get go. Don 't need to look at the size of a man...... I can smell the blood. It was on you too.
Yeah.
Good. Now, get my jacket clean if you can. If I 'm gonna die, I wanna look good doing it.
Done a good job on this garden.
Well, for a laundry man.
You do good shooting.
For a drunken man. Why you stop shooting?
Well, I just went around robbing banks, hitting trains...... till I ran into the only force that can truly bring down any outlaw. Sheriff?
Woman.
When I was with her, I didn 't wanna run.
What happened then? There was a couple of rangers who hadn 't forgot about me.
They ambushed me.
Bullets flying everywhere.
One of them found Beth.
Last thing she ever said to me was, "Don 't never pick up no gun again."
So far... Well, at least till today...... I done what she asked.
But for fellas like me and you...... we are what we are. If you truly love something or somebody, laundry man...... you get as far away from them as possible.
Because we 're sand...... they' re flowers.
These are yours. These are to kill.
Come.
Closer.
Here.
Here.
Here.
Remember these places. Fastest way to kill your enemy.
I will remember.
Company charge!
What was that?
H9) '- What the hell - -?
Come on!
Take cover!
Get up there. - Everybody, up there. - Over there, come on.
Come on, men.
Get them, down there.
Get down. Shoot them!
- Come on! - Move over!
Yeah!
Let 's go. Come on down.
Okay. Let 's get out of here.
Shoot them!
Oh, shit. - Dynamite! - Run for your lives!
Let 's move it!
Shit. We did it.
- Oh, no. - They hit Jacques.
Come on. Back to town. - Get back.
Let 's close this damn circus down! Burn it!
- Move it out. - Let 's go!
Come on!
Kill.
Run.
Hey, come on. Into the hotel. Keep low.
Get them!
Here, take her.
Skinny!
I couldn 't protect April.
Guard the hallway! And don 't let a damn soul into this room!
What the - -?
One more step and she 's soup.
I said stop!
That sure is a pretty scar I gave you.
I 'll see you in hell, little girl.
Wear something nasty.
Is this the new life you have found?
Funny, look much like the old one.
Do you think you will tell her that you killed her mother...... her father...... and her entire clan?
She is the enemy. She will always be the enemy.
You came to me to be strong. I have made you the strongest.
Kill her now.
You do not belong here. I do.
I did.
You have the perfect body for an assassin. The heart of a priest.
Your heart will become your biggest enemy.
You must kill your biggest enemy. We are assassins. All that we love...... we will destroy.
You are assassin. All that you love...... you will destroy.
Did we win? We survived. Some of us.
I 'm not going with you... "- 3711 I?
I guess that 's the end of them. No...... it is just the beginning. What about the baby, she gonna be safe?
Not her.
That 's right, sand man...... keep walking.
The warrior walked away. And legend has it, he never stopped walking. Always making sure to keep as much distance as possible...... between himself...... and the little gal he loved.
How much?
Free.
Thanks For Viewing Worldwide7477
You don 't understand. Krypton' s core is collapsing. We may only have matter of weeks.
Give me the control of the codex, I will ensure survival of our race. There is still hope, I have held that hope in my hand.
- This council has been disband. - On whose authority? Mine.
The rest of you will be trialled and punished accordingly.
What are you doing Zod, this is madness. What I should done years ago, these lawmakers with their endless debates. Had led krypton to ruin.
If Your forces prevail, You be the leader of nothing. Then join me, help me save our race we start anew.
You?
Don 't be the reason out, the last thing I want is us to be enemy' s. You have abandon the principles that bind us together, you have taken up a sword against your own people. I will honour the man you once were, Zod not this monster that you become.
Take him away.
sir, is everything all - right? - Out of the way! I said..
Get me Lara. Jor, Behind you!
Lara, you have to ready the launch, I will be with you soon as I can.
Have you seen the codex? its just beneath central house, sir. but I 'm compelled to warn you, reaching the chambers is class B crime punishable Nobody cares any more achilles the world is about coming to end.
Jor - el, by the authority of General zod, surrender the codex.
Easy now.
Did you find the world? We have. orbiting main yellow star just as you say it would a Yellow star. his cells will drink its radiation.
Its have seeming less intelligent population.
He will be a outcast, a freak.
They kill him. No... He will be a god to them.
I can 't do it. I thought I could, but.
Krypton is doomed. Its our only chance, now. Its our people only hope.
Just, let me look at him.
I never get to see him walk.
Never hear him our names.
Out there among the stars... he will live.
Goodbye my son. Our hopes and dreams travels with you.
Concentrate fire on the main door.
launch control coming on - line Proceed to ignition.
We have identified a emission within the citadel. Advance.
Hold this platform commander.
I know you stole the codex Jor - el surrendered it and I let you live. This is a second change for all of krypton, not just the bloodlines you deem worthy.
What have you done? We had a child Zod. A boy child.
Heresy!
Destroyed it!
Lara listen to me. Codex is krypton 's future. Abort the launch.
Your son Lara, where have you sent him.
His name is Kal. Son of El.
And he is beyond your reach.
Bring that ship down.
target locked
Lay down your weapons, your forces are surrounded.
General Zod, for the crimes of murder and high treason.
The council sentences you and your fellow accomplishes. To 300 hundred cycles of semantic recondition. Do you have any last words?
You won’t kill us yourself. You wouldn 't filthy your hands, But you damn us to black hole for eternity.
Jor - El, was right you are pack of fools, every last one of you! And you... and you believe your son is safe. I will find him.
I will find him.
I will find him Lara.
I Will Find Him!
Lara, shouldn 't we find refuge There is no refuge Achilles.
Jor - El was right, this is the end.
Build a better world than ours Kal.
Watch yourself, keep your eyes open or you are going to be squashed.
Where hell they find you, greenhorn.
Gentlemen secure the deck, we just got a distress call from a rig due west of us. Secure the deck!
Also all involved stand clear, sub sea valves failed, the rig is about to explode. Roger coast guard. - What about the men left inside, over.
Greenhorn.
I don 't know how much longer we can hold out!
This is coast guard 65 - 10. We are going to make one last pass then we are getting out of here.
Wait, we got guys on the heli - pad!
Where is that guy going, we have to gotta go! Hey let’s go!, what are you doing!
When Kansas become...
are you listening Clark?
I ask you to tell me who the settlers was.
Are you all - right Clark?
- Clark, get out of there. - Leave me alone. Clark I have called your mother.
Clark honey, what 's wrong?
How can I help you honey. The world is too big, mom.
Just a... Focus on my voice.
Pretend there is a Island. Out in the ocean. Can you see it.
I see it. Then swim towards it, honey.
What 's wrong with me mom.
Hey, azzwipe. What did you think of the game.
Leave him alone Pete. I want hear what he has to say.
Come on, dick splash.
My son was there, he was in the bus. He saw what Clark did. I know he didn 't.
This was providence.
Well, I think you are blowing little out of the proportion. No, I 'm not. Lana saw it too and the Forny boy.
- I just wanted to help. - I know you did, but we talked about this, Right.
Maybe.
There are more at stake here than just our lives Clark, there are lives around us.
When a world... when, world finds out what you can do its going to change everything. Our believes, our notions of... what it means to be human, everything. You saw how Pete 's mom, was reacting, right. she was scared, Clark.
Why? People are afraid what they don 't understand. Is she right.
We found you in this. We were sure that the government going to show on our doorstep. No one ever came.
This was in the chamber with you.
I took it to an Metallurgist, in Kansas state. He said, whatever it was made did even, did even exist on periodic - table.
Its another way saying its not from this world, Clark.
And neither are you.
You are the answer to Something. you are the answer to all we alone in universe. I don 't want to be. And I don' t blame you son.
All these changes that you going through one day, one day you are thinking them as a blessing. When that day comes, you have to make a choice, choice of whether to stand proud in front of human race or not..
Can I just keep pretending I 'm, your son. You are my son.
But somewhere out there, you have another father too. Who gave you another name.
And he send here for a reason, Clark.
And even if it take you rest of your life, you own it to yourself, to find out what that reason is.
They did find something strange in...
I know, its crazy right. the Americans are there too. Lots of them. they are calling it anomalous object, whatever that means. back off rebel, I 'm serious. Oh come on Chrissy.
Or what tough guy? Or going to have ask you to leave.
I think probably just leave when I 'm good and ready.
O, there he is.
Its not worth sweety.
Hey, asshole don 't forget your tip.
Thanks, hi. Miss Lane, how are you doing? - good. - Jed Eubanks Arctic cargo.
I got to confess miss Lane, I 'm not fan of the daily planet. But those you pieces you wrote.
Well, they were pretty impressive. Well, what can I say, I get writers block if I 'm not wearing a flat jacket.
Miss, Lane! Hardy US north - com, dr Emil Hamilton. You are early, we were excepting you tomorrow.
NASA cci satellites ping the anomaly first the ice shelf 's plates echo. But, there is definitely something down there. - A submarine, maybe from soviet era?
- Doubtful that 's 300m, considerably larger than anything they build back then. But, here is the spooky part. The ice surrounding the object, its nearly 20. 000 years old... miss Lane, do not wanderer.
There you go.
- What if I needed to pee. - There is bucket in the corner.
Where to hell you are going.
Its aright, Its aright..
You are haemorrhaging internally and if I don 't Cauterize this, you bleed.
I can do things other people can’t. Now, hold my hand. This is going to hurt.
I 'm not running a story about aliens, walking among us.
Never going to happen.
That 's a Scots straight up for the lady. I' m sending you the original article, my editor wont printed. but, if it happened leak to on line... but, didn 't you once describe my site as a,
- creeping cancer of false woods. - I stand by my words Woodburn. - But, I want this story out there.
precoursic diagnostic complete guidance process authenticated all systems operational
to see you standing there and grown to an adult.
- Only Lara could witness this. - Who are you? I 'm your father Kal.
My name is Jor - El.
And Kal?
Its my name. Kal - El, it is.
I have so many questions.
Where do I come from?, why did you send me here? You came from krypton. A world with much harsher environment than the earth 's.
A long ago, in era of expansion. Our race spread out through the stars. Seeking new worlds to settle upon.
This scout ship was one of thousands launched at to the void. We build outpost on other planets, using great machines to reshape environments to our needs.
For 100. 000 years our civilization flourished. - Accomplishing wonders. - What happened?
Artificial population control established. The outpost on space exploration was abandoned, we exhausted natural resources, as result... our planets core became unstable. Eventually our military leader, General Zod, attempted a cue by then it was too late.
your mother and I, for saw the coming calamity, and we took some steps to insure your survival.
This is a genesis chamber. All krypton 's is conceived in chambers such as this, every child was desired to fulfil pre detainment role in our society, as worker, a Warrior, a Leader.
Your mother and I, believed that krypton lost something precocious, the element of choice, of chance. What if a child dreamed become other than what society intended he wonder... and what if a child spotted to something greater. You were embodiment of that believe Kal, krypton 's first natural birth in centuries.
We couldn 't Kal. No matter how we wanted to. And how much we loved you.
So, I 'm alone.
You are much as a child of earth now as you are of krypton. You can embodied best of both worlds. A dream your mother and I dedicated our lives to preserve.
People of earth are different than us, its true. But ultimately I believe that is a good thing. They will not necessary make same mistake a we did.
And if give them hope.
That is what this symbol means. The symbol of house of EL means hope. Embodied in within that help is fundamental believe, the potential of every person to be a force for good.
that 's what you can bring them.
Why I 'm so difference from them?
Earth 's sun is younger and brighter than Krypton’s was. your cells grown in radiation.
Strengthen your muscles, skin, senses.
Earth gravity is weaker, yet, its atmosphere is more nourishing, you have grown stronger here than I ever could imagine. The only way to know how strong, is to keep testing your limits.
You will give the people of earth an ideal strafe towards.
they will rest behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. And in time... they will join you when the sun come.
In time, you help them accomplish wonders.
How, do you find someone who has spent a lifetime covering his tracks. You start with urban legends that have sprung in his wake. All the friends of the friends who claim to have see him.
For some he was a guardian angel. For others a cypher, a ghost who never quite fit in. As you work your way back in time.
I like to talk to you about an accident that occur when you were younger, a school bus that went in to the river.
Mrs Kent, I 'm Lois Lane from daily planet.
I 'm from daily planet and would like to talk about your son.
Where are you from?, what are you doing here, let me tell your story. - What if I don 't want my story told. - Its going to come out eventually.
My father believed. If the world found out, who I really was.
They reject me... Of fear.
I 'm tired of the safe! I just want do something useful with my life. So, farming isn' t useful.
I didn 't say that. Our family has been farming for 5 generations Clark. - your family. Not mine.
That 's all - right Martha.
He is right, Clark has a point. We are not your parents. But we have been doing best we can, and we have making it up as we go along, so maybe, maybe our best isn 't good enough anymore.
Look. Dad please. - hold on.
Go for the overpass.
Go for the overpass.
Take cover!, take cover! Over there just! follow them!
She 's stuck!
You guys follow me. The dog in the car!
I get him! Get your mom to the overpass.
Jonathan! Ma, stay here.
I let my father die, because I trusted him.
Because he was convinced, that I have to wait. That the world is not ready.
What do you think?
You better watch out Lois. Hey, Perry got it in for you, he knows you are Woodburn’s anonymous source...
I told you not to run with this. You let Woodburn just shotgun, it all over the internet. Now, the publishers want me to sue you.
- What happened to your leads? - They didn 't pan out. Or perhaps it just didn' t get the attraction you hope it would.
2 weeks leave, no pay that 's your appendence. You try something like this again your done here. No, let’s make it 3 weeks, since you are so willing to agreed with me.
I believe you saw something Lois, but not for a moment do I believe that your lead just went cold, so whatever your reason are for dropping it... I think you are doing a right thing. Why?
Can you imagine how people on this planet would react... If... they knew that there was someone like this out there.
Go get him!
Well look at you!
A reporter came by here. She is a friend, don 't worry.
Mom. What.
- I found them. - Whom?
My parents. My people. I know where I come from now.
Wow... That 's wonderful.
I 'm so happy for you.
- What? - Its nothing.
When you were a baby, I use to lay by your Cradle. Listen to your breath.
It was hard for you.
You struggled. - I worried all the time. - you worried that the truth could come out.
No, the truth about you... We saw that, the moment we lay eyes on you.
We knew that one day, the whole world would see that.
I just.
I worried they take you away from me.
I 'm not going anywhere mom.
I promise.
- General Swanwick sir. - What are I 'm looking at, doc. Comet?, asteroid?
Comets don 't make course corrections, General.
I want you see this before some amateur with a telescope creates a blueprint.. The ships appears to have inserted itself to lunar synchronous orbit. I have No idea why.
I 'm just speculating, but, I think who ever is on helm of that thing, is looking to make a dramatic entrance.
Does anybody know where, we keep toner cartridges
- what 's going on? - Its all over the news. You got to see this.
Yeah, coming.
Yoare no AL0
you are not alone
its coming over rr feeds. you are not alone its on my phone too.
My name is general Zod.
I come from a world far from yours. I have journeyed crossed a ocean star systems to reach you.
For Sometime your world has sheltered one of my citizens.
I request that you return this individual.
To my custody. For reasons unknown he has chosen to keep his existence a secret from you.
He had made efforts to blend in. He will look like you. But, he is not one of you.
To those of you who may know his current location. The faith of your planet rest in your hands.
To kal - el I say this.
Surrender within 24 hours.
Or watch this world suffer the consequences
If he truly means us no harm he should turn himself to his people, and face the consequences and if he won’t do that, then maybe we should. The daily planets Lois Lane knows who this guys is. And I think she 's the one we should question.
This is serious Lois, the FBI is here saying words like treason. I got to go.
Its the FBl, hands up drop the bag now!
Come on Kent.
come on, Fight back! Get up Kent.
Is that it? is that all you got.
Come on Kent. Come on!
Did they hurt you? You know they can’t. It was what I meant, are you all - right?
I wanted to hit that kid, I wanted to hit kid so bad. And I know you did, I mean. Part of me even wanted you too but then what, make you feel any better.
You must decide what kind of man you really want grow up to be Clark. Because... whatever that man has a good character or bad, he is.
He is going to change the world.
What 's on your mind.
I don 't where to start. Where ever you want.
That ship that appeared last night. I 'm the one they are looking for.
Do you know... why they want you. - no. With this general zod, even if I surrender there 's no grantee he keeps his word. There is chance I can safe earth by turning myself in.
Zod can’t be trusted.
Problem is... I 'm not sure people of earth can be either.
Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith first, the trust part comes later.
Al - right, you got our attention. - What it is you want? - I would like to speak to Lois Lane.
Why are you surrendering to Zod. I surrendering to mankind, there is a difference.
You let them handcuff you. Would not be much of a surrender if I resisted. And makes them feel more secure, then all the better for it.
What 's the S stand for.
Its not an a S, on my world its meant hope.
Well, here its an S. How about...
sir, hi
- my name is doctor.. - Emil Hamilton, I know. I can see your id tag in your breast pocket, along with half eaten roll of pastrami sandwich.
I can also see tranquillize needle you won’t need it. Sir, you cannot except to not take preconceptions, you could be carrying some kind alien pathogen. I been here for 33 years doctor, haven 't infected anyone yet.
Zod? That 's what I' m worried about. Be as it may,
Thank you.
For believing in me.
Didn 't make much difference in the end. It did to me.
They are coming.
Go, Lois.
Kal - El, I 'm sub commander Faora - Ul. On behalf of general Zod I extend you his greetings.
- Are you the ranking officer here? - I am. General Zod, would like. this woman to accompany me. you asked for the alien.
I 'll go.
The atmosphere composition in our ship is not compatible with humans. You will need wear a breather beyond this point.
Kal - El.
You don 't have no idea how long we been searching for you. I take you are zod. General Zod, our Commander!
I, feel strange.
- What 's happening to him? - He is rejecting our ships atmospherics.
Spend a lifetime adapting to earth 's ecology but never adapted to ours. Help him! I can’t whatever is happening its better running its course.
Hello Kal.
Or do you prefer Clark. That 's the name they gave you, isn' t it.
I was krypton 's military leader, your father our foremost scientist. The only thing we agreed on was that krypton was dying. In return for my evidence to protect our civilization.
And then destruction of our world... freed us.
We were adrift. Destined float amongst the ruins of our planet until we starved.
how did you find a way to earth? We manage to retro fit the phantom projector into hyper drive.
So the instrument of our damnation..
Became our salvage.
We seek through old colonial outposts. Looking for signs of life.
But all we found was death. Cut off from krypton these outpost wither and died long ago.
We salvage what we could. armour, weapons. Even a world - engine.
For 32 years we prepared, until finally, detected a distress beacon. Which you triggered when you accessed ancient scout ship. You lead us here, Kal.
And now it is in within your power to safe what remains of your race.
On krypton, the genetic of every being yet to be born, is encoded in the register of citizens.
Your father stole the registers codex and stored in the capsule that brought you here. For what purpose? So, that krypton can live again, on earth.
Where is the codex Kal.
If krypton lives again, what happens to earth? A foundation has to be build on something.
Even your father recognized that.
No, Zod.
I can’t be part of this. Then what can you be part of.
Stop!
Your father acquitted himself with honour Kal.
You killed him? I did. And not a day goes by when its doesn 't haunt me.
2 bogeys launching from the alien ship. Put it out. - yes, sir. There it is.
- Air speed? - 380 knots they are not responding to our hails. You are wasting your efforts.
For your exposure to earth 's sun......
You are not as weak as a human.
- Where did you come from? - The command key Kal send. Thanks to you I 'm uploaded to the ships main frame.
Can you help us? I designed this ship. I can modify its atmospheric composition to human compatibility.
Ship 's crew alerted need to move quickly. command key.
did you do that? - yes. pick up a slider.
What 's happening:
Fire.
Behind you.
Secure yourself inside the open pod. Safe travels, miss Lane. It 's highly unlikely we will be seeing each other again.
Move your head to the left.
Is it true what Zod said about the codex. Strike that panel.
we wanted you to learn what it meant to be a human first.
So one day, when the time was right. you could be the bridge between 2 peoples.
Look.
Lois. You can safe her, Kal.
You can save all of them.
You will be safe here.
- Are you all - right? - Oh yeah.
I 'm sorry. I didn' t meant to tell anything about you, but they did something to me... they did same thing to me.
The craft he arrived in, where is it.
Go to hell.
There.
The codex is not here.
Where has he hidden it. I don 't know. Where Is The Codex!
You been frighten my mother!
What have you done to me? My parents taught me to home my senses, Zod.
To focus. On just what I want to see and without your helmet, you are getting everything.
And its hurts, doesn 't it.
Get inside, its not safe.
All clear, this is guardian - I 'm air born mission commander. I have previously encounter beings we are about to engage close proximity, they are extremely dangerous we are authorize to use deadly force.
Guardian advanced to target.
Requesting immediately re attack. Roger guardian.
eject!, eject!
I have a bogey incoming!
You are weak, son of El. Unsure of yourself.
The fact, that you posses sense of morality and we do not. Gives us a evolutionary advantaged.
And history has proven,
it is that the evolution always wins.
I need you engage the targets. Guardian, this is battle 01, what about that guy in blue? I say engage all targets.
Are you okay?
We are going in hard.
Break for impact! We are going in hard.
Guardian is down, I repeat guardian is down.
Guardian, guardian do you read? This is guardian, I want you to put down everything you got at my position, this will be danger close. Copy, danger close.
A good death is its own reward.
You will not win, for ever you safe we kill million more.
This man is not our enemy.
Thank you, General.
Mom! I 'm all - right.
Nice suit, son. I 'm so sorry. its only stuff, Clark. We can always build a new place.
But you can 't be. mom.
Zod says, this codex his looking for can actually bring my people back. is it that a good thing?
I don 't think they are interested sharing this world. Clark. Clark!
I know how to stop them.
- What happened down there? - He exposed a temporary weakness. It is of little inconvenience, because I have located the codex.
It was never in the capsule.
Jor - el, took the codex, a DNA of an billion people.. And he bonded it with his sons individual cells, all krypton 's heirs, Living in one refugees body.
Does Kal - el need to be alive, for us to extract the codex from his cells. No.
Released the world - engine.
What did just happened. The ships just split in 2, track 1 is heading east, track 2 is deploying towards southern hemisphere. - How fast is that bogey moving?
- Rest of the ship is descending. - Put it on board now.
O. M. G
Bring the phantom drive on - line.
We are now sled to the world edge.
Initiated.
What can they hit us with? Looks like some kind of gravity weapon, its working in tandem with their ship. Somehow they are increasing earth mass, clouding the atmosphere with particulates.
O. M. G. they are Terra - forming. What 's that? Planetary engineering modifying earth' s atmosphere and topography.
- We have a plan general. - Is that what I think it is? Its the ship he arrived in.
Zod ship use the same technology if we can make 2 drives collide with one other. - Singularity could be created, - Like a black hole.
Theoretically they should be pulled back in. So, you want us bomb them with that? General, if that craft maxi out 17000 pounds we drop it from a c - 17.
If that thing is making earth more like in krypton, would you be weaker around it? Maybe, I 'm not going let that stuff stop me trying. You may want step back a little bit.
Maybe, a little bit more.
- Let Urea take command. - Yes sir I need to secure the Genesis chamber, pay my respects to an old friend.
Guardian in route to the metropolis.
- command key accepted, Genesis chamber coming on - line, sir. stop this Zod, while there still time.
Haven 't giving up lecturing me have you, even in death. I will not let you use the codex like this. You don' t have the power to stop me.
North com lightning requesting permission unleash the hell. North com lightning 1, you are clear to engage. Send battle damage assessment when able, out.
All right everybody! we are leaving, leaving the building now.
Everybody Get back!, Get back!, Keep moving, keep moving.
Our people can co exist. So we can suffer through years of pain trying to adapt like your son has? You are talking about genocide.
We are both ghost Zod, can’t you see that. The krypton you cling on is gone.
- I 'm tired about this debate. - Silencing me won’t change anything. My son, is twice the man you are.
He will finish what we started. I can promise you that.
Tell me, you have Jor - Ells memory 's, his conscience. Can you experience his pain. I will harvest the codex from your son' s corps.
Jenny, where are you! I 'm here! - hold on, hold on. I' m stuck.
- No, no please! don 't leave me. - I' m not going to leave you. Robert, get your ass over here and help me.
Try this.
Come on push!
This is guardian, are we clear to make the drop. Negative guardian.
He did it.
North - com, this is guardian, and we are god to go.
Godspeed guardian, on the package. You are cleared out. We are lining in for the final run.
Load master is it package on. - are we ready to drop. - Negative. There is something wrong, its not pose to this.
We are lining for drop, What 's the hold up! Kind of slight set back.
Target that air craft.
target locked
if destroy this ship.. You destroy krypton.
Krypton has its chance.
Are they gone? I think so. He saved us.
You know they say its downhill after the first kiss.
I 'm pretty sure, nobody cares if I' m kissing a human.
Look at this... we could build a new krypton in here. But you chose humans over us. I exist only to protect Krypton... that is sole purpose which I was born, and every action I take, no matter how violent, or how cruel, is for the greater good.
and now I have no people.
My soul... that is what you have taken from me!
I 'm going to make them suffer Kal, these humans you adopted. - I will take them all from you, one by one. - You are a monster Zod.
I 'm going to stop you.
There is only one way this end Kal, either you die or I do!
I was bred to be a warrior Kal, trained my entire life, to master my senses, where did you trained, on a farm!
If you love these people so much..
Don 't do this!
Stop!
Are you F - ing stupid. That one of your surveillance drones. That 's a 12 million $piece of hardware. - it was.
- what are you smiling about captain. - Nothing sir.
I just think he is kind of hot.
- Get in the car captain. - Yes sir.
He always believed you were meant for greater things, and when the day came, your shoulders will be able to bare the weight. So, he could be around to see finally happen. He saw it Clark, believe me.
What are you going to do, when you are not saving the world. Have you given any thought to that. I have actually.
Where people move twice, when I want go somewhere dangerous, start asking questions.
Come on Lois, when are you going to throw me a bone. Court side seats to the game tonight, what do you say? I say, you should go back to trolling the intern pool you probably have more luck.
sorry.
court side?
Lombardi, Lane. Want you to meet our new stringer, want you to show him the ropes. this is Clark Kent, good luck kid.
Hey, Steve nice to meet you.
Lois Lane, welcome to Planet.
Glad to be here, Lois.

Okay. Open your textbooks to page 207.
I take it everyone did the reading last night.
How 's it going?
The Civil War.
Key battles. Can anybody tell me the significance of the date July 21, 1861?
Matthew Caldwell.
Uh, it was the first battle of Bull Run. That 's correct. But can you tell me who won?
Well, it was a real mess. But Colonel Thomas J. Jackson got the credit and his nickname Stonewall for rallying Johnny Reb and driving the Union back to D. C. Very good.
Since the Confederacy captured the Union supply depot at Manassas Junction - -
Death from above. You know I hate you, right? No, I mean, just - - I just want to let you know.
How do you eat that garbage? You mean this?
Okay. All right. I 'm out of here.
Hey, Lendie. Check this out.
Shit.
So, who 's the dead man?
Hey, Matt. Check this out. It costs four rubies for a Dwarf spell.
That was mine. What 'd you say?
Cam. Cam. You two.
Let 's go, Colts!
Team, let 's go!
Dude, do you think that maybe someday we can get out of school at the same time as everyone else?
Look at that. It 's that little weasel.
Come on.
Let 's go, Colts! Let' s go, Colts! Let 's go, Colts!
What 's up, Chief?
Well, I can see why you like to sit here.
I mean, suddenly, I just got some more school spirit.
Jess, what 's up? You see those Riddle boys talking to your brother?
He 's fine.
All right, girls, let 's go again.
It 's Nathan, right?
Yeah.
Hey, you a motor - head? Got a '73 Plymouth' Cuda, dual exhaust, V8.
318? Hell, yeah! He 's not joking, dude.
I - - I can 't. I - - I have to wait for my sister. Come on.
 Our ship is burning 20 miles off the coast  Whoo - hoo!
 And as she slides into the darkened sea   I 'm haunted by this melody...  GlRL: Ready?
When are you gonna take me back?
You like chicken? Quit playing around, man.
Come on.
Whoo!
Yeah! Whoo!
Oh, yeah! Whoo! Ha ha.
Stop being a little girl. I didn 't scare you, did I?
Son of a bitch! He pissed himself.
On the new seat covers.
Dude, get out. Get out. Out of the car, man.
Heh. Dude, there 's a bathroom by the garage. Why don' t you get cleaned up, all right?
 I 'd find someone like you 
 The kind of dream  I 've always held on to 
I 'll get the kid.
Maybe he fell in.
Hey, buddy? You ready?
You in here?
Where 's Nathan?
I don 't know.
Please be okay.
Have a drink for me.
You like that one? Sir, your change. Thank you.
Hey. Is that all for you? Yeah.
You 've been a huge help today, Holly. Oh, are you kidding? I love the market.
Oh. Sorry.
Oh, dear. Are you okay?
Yeah, can you cover for me for a minute?
Nathan?
Excuse me, sir? Did somebody just buy firewood from you? Plenty have, all day long.
Well, he never said. He don 't say much. I think he gets his stock over in Riddle.
Why do you ask?
Are you okay, sweetie? Yeah. Everything 's fine.
... and the Beast that was and is nigh, even is the eighth and is of the seventh and goeth into perdi - -
Hey there.
No, don 't be afraid!
Excuse me, sir?
Can you tell me where the police station is?
Sir?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I really need to speak to the sheriff. What 's the name? Holly Teller.
He 's in a meeting. Take a seat. Could I use your phone?
I suppose.
Hey, this is Dave Teller. I 'm not available to take your call right now, but if you leave a message, I' ll get back to you as soon I can.
Thank you.
MAN: Amber. Oh, God.
Bill.
Look who 's here.
Sheriff Richards. I 'm Holly Teller, Nathan Teller' s sister.
What can I do for you? I saw my brother. He 's alive, and I think he' s here in Riddle.
Well, I saw a man in a truck. Nathan was riding with him. Ms. Teller, when family members suffer a loss, it can be very difficult.
Have a seat.
Now, unless there 's any new evidence, then the case is closed.
But I told you, I - - I saw him.
Well, lots of people saw him or claimed that they saw him. That 's the problem. Nothing ever happens.
Because he 's not in Jefferson. He' s here. You 're just refusing to believe me.
When your little brother went missing, it was as if this entire town was put on trial. The FBl, state troopers, everyone came in like the Knights Templar. Everyone knew best.
How could you turn your back to that?
You 're just another outsider coming in on your white horse, making demands. We' ve done all that we could do.
So that 's it?
Sometimes your problems are your own.
No, it 's semiautomatic. Come on. Let me just hold it.
Look, I gotta get back, all right? All right, then.
You 're Holly Teller.
We went to school together.
I know who you are.
So, uh, what are you doing here in Riddle?
I was hoping to get help from the Sheriff. From my dad? Yeah, he 's anything but helpful.
Is, uh, this about your brother?
Yeah.
Come on.
Bill... this gonna be a problem?
Don 't you worry about it. This doesn' t concern you.
Mm - hmm.
These past few years must have been pretty hard on you.
Doesn 't help that everybody wants to forget.
My parents have been really strong, but... even they 're starting to give up hope.
Yeah, well, at least you still have your parents.
My dad and I - - have a terrible relationship.
I was kind of counting on him to show a little bit more compassion.
Yeah. Ha ha ha. Well, don 't take it personally.
No, he thinks anybody who comes here is some kind of... threat to his little world.
You know, my grandmother used to show me these pictures. Before that hospital closed down, this place really wasn 't that bad. I mean, there was a hotel and a bank.
That didn 't happen here.
Those boys... they were from here. Holly, they just went for a ride.
That 's it.
Nobody knows what happened after that.
I know. That 's not what I meant. I - -
I need a drink.
 Gotta spread the money blues...  Amber, hold on.
There 's something I need to explain. Relax. Sam?
What? At the farmers' market back in Jefferson. This guy had him in his pickup truck.
I think the guy lives in Riddle. That 's why I came here.
Are you sure it was him?
I couldn 't get that close of a look, but... I know my brother. It had to be him.
That 's why you were talking to my dad.
But why would... There must be something he 's not telling you.
What are you saying?
I 'll be right back.
Get lost, wench.
Look who 's here.
 You know that beggars can 't choose   Gotta spread the money...  You' re that girl, aren 't you?
The one whose brother went missing?  Beggars can 't choose  Gotta spread the money blues  I' m sorry. I should keep my stupid mouth shut.
Wait.
What do you know about it?
I can 't talk about this right now.
MAN: Sam! Another round.
Holly.
What are you doing? I don 't want to talk to him. Hi, Holly.
We 're in.
AMBER: Found it.
"Myotonia Congenita. Thompson 's Disease." Does that mean anything to you?
"Name of child, Nathan Bristol."
"Place of birth, Riddle, Pennsylvania." Birth parents, Gene and Sandra Bristol.
"Known siblings, Holly Bristol."
You were adopted?
Riddle psychiatric files? Oh. Hold on.
AMBER: Bristol. Bristol.
"January 17, 1989,
"Gene Bristol was arrested by authorities
"at 7: 31 in the morning after a neighbor reported a disturbance at the residence." "He had taken the life of Sandra Bristol, stabbing her 13 times in the chest and back."
Oh, God.
It says, "Gene Bristol, pronounced unfit to stand trial,
"has been committed to Riddle Psychiatric Hospital on this day of March 15, 1989."
We gotta get out of here. Let 's go.
 The chip inside my mind  The one behind my eyes...  Hey. Anything left to drink?
Um... whiskey.  Of a shrine  Pulsing in the head  I don 't even sleep anymore   A NASA weather vane  Transmissions from outer space   Weird skies at night... Dude, what' s she doing here? You 're not gonna believe this shit.
Hey.
 I don 't even sleep any more...  You know, their lives changed a lot that day, too.  Transmissions from outer space...  I know.
I know. I just wasn 't expecting all this.
I just want to find my brother.
What else does it say?
"Gene Bristol, declared dead along with 43 others, September 3, 1989." That was the night of the fire.
The hospital became a place for the criminally insane... but not everyone in town approved.
Okay, boys. Let 's fire it up.
There were questions of security and rumors of patient abuse.
When a local nurse was killed... chaos broke out within the walls.
CAMERON: The asylum was put on lockdown.
It 's the way it has to be.
CAMERON: That 's when the fire started.
It could have been the prisoners. Some think it was hospital administrators.
Others blamed a group of kids.
Many were burned alive.
It 's not all peachy keen and white picket fences, like in Jefferson.
Well, actually, Holly was born here in Riddle.
That makes you one of us.
[high - pitched] One of us. One of us.
Okay, let 's go ahead and, uh - - This one. Yes, Doctor.
Great. Thanks.
CAMERON: Check this out.
Aww.
Hey there, sleepyhead. What 's that?
"Holly, meet me at the quarry in an hour.
"It 's about your brother. Come alone. Sam."
Can you tell me how to get there?
Wait. What exactly did she say? She just said she had to take care of something.
That my daughter?
Did she at least say where she was going? Could you stop asking me a million questions? You guys starting early?
Sam?
Glad you could make it.
Who are you? Where 's Sam? I' m the man you want to talk to.
You 're not gonna find your brother.
What do you know about Nathan? You know, there 's a lot you don' t know about our little town. You 've been snooping around where you don' t belong.
Look, I saw my brother. I saw him. I know he 's here.
We don 't share our secrets.
Where is he?
You don 't understand, do you, sweetheart? Don' t touch me. Hey!
No. No. You made a big mistake coming here.
Are you okay?
Oh, look out!
It 's Jack Abel.
What was he doing here? Wouldn 't expect him to do something like this. What did you do?
He was gonna tell me something. I know it. Holly... what is wrong with you?
What was I supposed to do?
We have to tell the sheriff.
No. Look, we can 't do that.
They 'll - - They' ll never believe us. The guy 's dead, Cam. We kind of have to report it.
And besides, Amber 's dad has been gunning for us since we were kids.
Cam is right. It was just a mistake, especially with Holly being here.
Wait. Holly.
This has gotten way out of hand.
Nathan 's gone, isn' t he?
I 'm not sure.
I don 't know what I' m doing here anymore.
I need to go home.
You kids been getting into trouble?
Amber, get in the car. And you, darlin ', I think you' ve overstayed your welcome.
Amber, I said get in the car.
Hey, look, you don 't have to listen to him.
Don 't even try it.
Put that shotgun down.
All right, this charade is over. I don 't want to see the four of you together again.
Hey.
Hey, I want you to know that we really liked your brother.
And I 'm sorry.
Cam and I, we were immature, and we - - we didn 't mean for any of this to happen.
It 's okay.
I understand.
Holly, Hal will get you up and running in no time.
All right, kids. Get her back to my place.
What, you 're not gonna tow it?
It 's a block away. Push.
So... how 's the college life?
It 's different, that' s for sure. Yeah. It 's definitely not for me.
You must have wanted to leave here at some point.
Why would I want to live anywhere else? People don 't care what you do here. We just party, and we can do whatever we want.
Plus, you know, what would these two do without me?
Foreign cars, that 's my specialty.
Yeah, I 've seen radiators like this. Might even have one of these fancies lying around here.
Hey, Cam, it 's your old coupe. Hey, put that back.
That 's Veronica. Heh heh. Nothing wrong with naming your car after a girl.
Sport, did you hear what I said?
HAL: Oh, yeah. Veronica.
What about this one?
'86 Silverado. That numskull, always chewing up his tires.
Can you tell me where I might find the owner?
Well, I can 't say. We don' t, uh, talk about other folks like that around here. MATT:
We 're gonna talk about it.
How long have we been walking? I cannot feel my feet.
I don 't even know what we' re looking for.
The mechanic said he drives on these tracks. There 's gotta be something.
Well, I mean, look, we 've been out here for hours. It' s gonna be dark soon.
Yeah, we 'll come back.
CAM: Hey, guys! Down here!
I think I found something.
Look. Tire tracks.
This has to be it.
CAM: Wow. I didn 't know this was up here.
Holly, hang with me.
Come on.
Look at this place.
Home, sweet home.
Come on.
Keep a lookout. Whistle if you see anything. Cam?
Hello.
Stay close.
Matt! Over here.
Won 't budge.
No shit.
Hang in there, buddy.
Hey, guys, I found him. Nathan? He 's locked in the pen.
Nathan? I 'm going to get Amber. Yeah.
Nathan. What are you - - Nathan.
It 's locked. Can you pick it? Yeah, yeah, I think so.
No.
I 'll check it out.
We have to get out. I 'm not leaving Nathan. Holly.
What, you want to get rough, old man?
Come on. Let 's go.
No!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
No!
H - Help me! Help me!
Help!
You 're late, pretty boy. Just making the rounds.
No Jack Abel tonight? Looks that way. What are you in for?
How 'bout 20?
20, it is.
No!
Holly!
Holly... your brother stays with me.
You... belong with your mother.
Yaah!
Oh, my God.
No.
Help me! Somebody help me. Please, what are you doing?
Please. Please. Please.
Please.
Ow. Ow.
No.
Nurse... prepare the conductor.
Two ladies.
I 'm calling it a night. Luck' s not running your way, huh, boss?
Just rags tonight.
Clark! Jersey, get an ambulance out here.
We learn through pain.
Okay. On my mark.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
Okay. Oh, God. It 's okay.
She wasn 't lying.
She wasn 't lying.
Sandra?
Oh, hey. Hey.
I 'm here now.
Hey. I thought I 'd lost you.
Nathan?
Nathan?
Nathan, please say something.
Hey. Hey, hey.
I 'm here. I have you now.
This is Clark. We 're at the compound now. Jersey and Bobby are searching the grounds.
They found the Teller boy.
God damn.
Sheriff Richards! Can you comment on the incident?
Sheriff? Let 's give him some room. All right?
Hey.
You okay?
I want you to meet someone.
Thank you.
All right, here we go.
1, 2...
Ms. Teller.
I need to know what happened up there.
Well, Sheriff... sometimes your problems are your own.
Oh, my God. My baby.
Oh. Oh, my God.

SARAH: I should go to the police.
They 're probably already there.
Maybe we should split town for a while.
[truck horn honks]
Here. Have a coffee, a muffin. It 'll help you feel better.
The girl is Ellen, my roommate. She was on her own. She 'd lost her parents a couple years ago in some accident, fell into drugs.
We got into a fight... because I asked her not to get loaded around me. A couple hours later, I heard her fighting with the guy next door, Eddie, her dealer.
And I saw her... on the couch sleeping.
Only, she wasn 't breathing.
I don 't do that anymore.
Okay.
SARAH: Thank you for last night. It really meant a lot to me.
You don 't... think I' m trash?
Everybody 's got a story.
Anyway, I wouldn 't worry about it.
Okay.

Unbelievable.
I mean, you guys could be twins.
We are one strike away. I, uh - - I got an idea.
What?
It 's - - it' s a bit crazy, but it could work. Nobody on. A perfect game.

Very good.
[ice clinks]
And I like that.
[doorbell rings]
How do you do? You must be... Billy.
Ellen 's friend. [Chuckles]
Cameron Brogden. Good to meet you. - Please.
Okay, you just need to sign right there. Oh, oh, first I 'm gonna need to see
- some picture I. D. - Oh, sure. You know, a driver 's license, birth cert, passport, something like that.
It 's just a formality. [Sarah laughs nervously]
[Clears throat]
Okay. Heh. If you could sign right there.
Well, should I show you around the property? Sure. All right.
[wind blowing]
[Machinery grinding]
SARAH: I have a question. What kind of money are we talking about?
Oh. [Birds squawking]
[wind blowing]
We just walk over to that hill... you can get a view of the whole place. Right over there, that 's God' s country.
See that second ridge, right there?
Right along there, that 's the border, the second ridge, and it goes all the way around.
[Metal creaks]
What 's that turned - over tractor doing there? Oh. Oh, that' s - -
Well... nobody knows for sure, you know, but maybe the heat was a factor. It was over 100 degrees that day. He flipped the tractor.
Thanks for your time, folks.
I 'm real sorry about your loss. Thanks. I' ll try and do my best to make things as easy as possible for you.
You two have a good evening.
That guy makes me nervous.
You did great, except you shouldn 't have pushed so hard about the old man' s money.
Everything all right with you boys? Well, everything 's fine now that you' re here. Huh.
All right. We Will.
That cookie pusher 's got the hots for you, little brother. Please. Heh heh.
Don 't it strike you the least bit strange that he leaves all that scratch to some girl he barely knew? No. It' s called inheritance, Bob.

The last thing we need is someone else thinking they can get in on the money. [bell tolling]
Hurry up, fat man.
[Electricity sparks]
Hey! Hey! Hey!

Look at this thing. Whoa.
It 's a hunting rifle. Be careful.
Put it away.
Please?

It 's okay. SARAH: Did we shoot somebody?
HEM HEY. hey, hombre! Had a small accident.
Need a lift into town.
[Gasps]
Thank God you 're back. I was so worried. I looked everywhere.
You didn 't, uh, tell anybody about us coming here, did you?
What?
[groaning]
I can 't believe you would even ask me that. Okay. Okay.
Sorry. [groaning]
But what about the car? I mean, somebody is gonna be looking for that. What do you want me to do?
I wouldn 't worry about it. I' ll make sure nobody 'll find it.
Anyway, I pushed the El Camino to the old barn next to Niles' Caddy.
[Police dispatch chatter]
We haven 't had nothin' like this for a while, Sal. - Where 'd it happen? - I know.
I saw him, Bob. Must 've been a city hoodlum,' cause he got in there and hot - wired that sum - bitch in less than two seconds.
'67 blue El Camino, right, Sal? License plate (274436? That is correct, sir.
[Car approaching]
[engine stops, door opens]
Ellen 's asleep. BELLE: Oh.
I, uh, wouldn 't mind keeping the place clean for you, too.
That 's very kind. We' re not gonna be here for that much longer.
[Police dispatch chatter]
Howdy.
Sheriff Robert Brogden. Nice to make your acquaintance.
What can I do for you? Well, me and Deputy Fenway here are looking for a stolen car, an old El Camino, blue, metallic. Don 't suppose y' all know something about it?
Excuse me. Of course.
Yeah, sometimes kids' ll take a car out for a joy ride and then dump it in the fields.
I wish I could help, but I haven 't seen it.
You don 't mind if we look around the property, do you?
No, not at all.
You get them pictures? Oh, yeah. What exactly are you up to, boss?
What about that barn?
What are you doing? We cannot afford to let that hillbilly arrest us. You 're crazy.
[grunting]
Honey?
Bob? What are you doing bothering these nice young people?
Not bothering a soul. Ha ha. You need a search warrant to search people 's property.
What would I do without you, little bro?
I 've enjoyed about as much of this as I can stand.
Earl.
I 'm so sorry about my overzealous brother. He' s, uh, been like that since we were kids. Brothers?
A hiccup? Mm - hmm.
Somebody has filed an injunction. An - - An injunction?
Who? I don 't know. Some guy' s claiming he 's Niles' son.
What 's this? I found this a few days ago.
[Chuckles]
This is very telling.
I 'm glad you showed this to me. This will definitely help your case.
But you still gonna need something more. More?
This isn 't his letter. What you need is something written by him, that says all of his estate goes to Ellen, despite any other claims. What, uh...
It 's just, uh... it' s just gonna take a little more time, and round here, we ain 't got nothin' but time. SARAH: I think we should get out of here.
Ellen 's dead.
We 're stealing her money.
Billy, nothing is right about any of this. Look“. Hey, let 's just stick with this a little longer, and if it gets too dicey, we leave.
What do you think?
I think you 're nuts.
[Metal clatters]
Did you hear that?
[Door creaks open]
[Door closes]

[dirt bike revs]
[classical music plays] MAN: Ha ha ha.
[distorted] your daddy?
Yeah, that - a - boy, Jamie. That - a - boy.
Who 's your master? Go on. Go on now.
Are we having fun now, Zachary?
[bell tolling]
[Screams]
Start the car, or I 'll break your neck.
It 's your old pal, Eddie.
You little bitch. That was me on the porch. That was me who took a fucking bullet in the gut.
[Groans]
I followed your ass 1, 700 fucking miles.
Your dead cunt friend Ellen, the one with the rich uncle, owes me a lot of cash.
And guess what? You, little twit, will pay up. Do you understand?
Question... What 's the boyfriend' s name?
He 's just a guy.
He 's nobody.
Aah!
What 's the boyfriend' s name? Billy.
Billy. Okay.
Now, you keep it nice and quiet about me bumping into you. Aah! Otherwise...
[Sarah gasps]
I 'm here to collect on Ellen' s behalf.
Soto speak. The lawyer said it 'll be a few more days before he' s gonna transfer the assets.
And by the way, I want my piece back. You could come by tomorrow, room 212.
Here 's a little treat, for old time' s sake. You got a good scam going, Sarah.
I 'll see you tomorrow.
CAMERON: A burglary? Jesus Christ.
On his way out, he dropped something, a DVD. [classical music playing]
I 've seen - - I' ve seen about - - just about enough of that. If you 'll excuse me, I' m going to go lie down. I 'm not feeling too well.
I 'll talk to you later. [whistles]
I 'm gonna get rid of this filth. I mean, Zachary Niles has a respectable reputation. Its getting tainted now is not gonna help our cause.
Not really. Men with homosexual tastes fathering children... happens every day. - In your professional opinion...
- Mm - hmm. How much longer is this whole ordeal gonna last? Well - - Hmm.
[Sighs]
A month or two?
Mm - hmm. I don 't think we could stay that long.
Are you folks strapped for cash? 'Cause you know I have power of attorney. It wouldn' t be improper for me to forward Ellen some money.
How much you have in mind?
HOW 'bout $5, 000?
We 'll wait.
We 'll wait for the settlement.
Okay. Suit yourself.
I gotta get going - Well - - Well, Billy, you know anything about art?
See this painting here? I believe he paid 135, 000 for that one. You 'd probably fetch twice that at any art auction today. $135, 000?
It 'll all work itself out.
Have a good day.
SHERlFF: Anybody you recognizing? No, I ain 't seen the mean - looking one.
The lottery winners. Heh heh. Bob!
I ain 't teaching preschool. You don' t know what you 're missing.
[laughs]
- Oh, I gotta go.
- [sizzling]
I got something important to relay to you, boss.
What is it? They faxed over the coroner 's report.
Rules out heat stroke as the cause of death, said Niles died of suffocation.
[Sighs]
Now ain 't that a pisser?
[wind blows]
[bubbling]
Where have you been?
You okay?
You, uh - - You seem...
I hate this place.
EARL: This time, we got a warrant.
You got that right, Earl.
[siren blares]
What 's he doing here?
Mind if I come along?
Be my guest.
[Police dispatch chatter]
SHERlFF: How we doing, boys? Any prints?
Son, you don 't mind if we take your fingerprints, do you? I' m talking you and Ms. Niles. You two could fall by the station first thing in the morning, it 'd be appreciated.
Fingerprints? Yeah. It 's a tradition here in Tremo, kind of a keepsake to remember you by.

Let 's say - - Suppose the old man has an illegitimate child who was trying to get some of his money. What would be the quickest way to find a - - some kind of solution?
Solution? Listen. You need a document stating that Niles wanted his money going to his niece and his niece only.
Well, you got a problem then, don 't you? Yeah, I' ll bet Niles knew all about this, 'cause he came to me two days before he passed away.
He was gonna have me change his will to explicitly exclude anyone but Ellen.
Hmm.
Kind of a coincidence, don 't you think?
Niles ends up dead right before he intends to change his will.

You and your late husband, you, uh - - you raised two sons, Sheriff Bob and Cameron. Yes, that 's right.
Your family didn 't mind all those long hours with you keeping house for Zachary Niles?
Well, they - - It was a privilege to work for someone as accomplished and - - and prosperous as Mr. Niles.
And we needed the extra money. Heh.
You, the late sheriff, Bob... you 're like three peas in a pod.
[laughs] Yes.
Not Cameron, though.
Well, I don 't know what you mean. You truly admired and respected Niles, right?
Yes, of course. I told you. That - -
How dare you? I read the letters you wrote him, the ones asking him to acknowledge your son.
How could you stand for it?
After the way you took care of him?
After the way you felt about him?
It wasn 't that simple.
What would people think if they knew what we were up to?
How would they treat my family, my husband, my two little boys?
Cameron is Niles' son.
And when Niles handed the inheritance to Ellen, Cameron realized that he was gonna be cut out of everything that was rightfully his, out out... just like his mother had been.
You have no right - - Deep down, you have to know... that it was Cameron that killed Niles.
That is not possible. Zach - - Mr. Niles' death was an accident.
No, no. No, you 're not up on current affairs, ma' am. The coroner 's office ruled Niles' death a homicide.

That guy is Ellen 's dealer. She owed him a ton of money, and for some reason, he thinks I' m the one who has to pay him back. Well, he 's dead now.
Might as well get rid of me next, right? I assume that is the plan, after all.

We now have the general tools
to really tackle any multiplication problems.
So in this video I 'm just going to do a ton of examples.
So let 's start off with - - and I' ll start in yellow.
Let 's start off with thirty - two times eighteen.
Say eight times two is sixteen.
Well, I 'll do it in our head this time
because you don 't always have all this space to work with.
So eight times two is sixteen.
Put the one up there.
Eight times three is twenty - four.
Twenty - four plus one is twenty - five.
So eight times thirty - two was two hundred fifty - six.
Now we 're going to have to multiply this one,
which is really a ten, times thirty - two.
I 'll underline it with the orange.
One times two - - oh, we have to be very careful here.
One times two is two.
So you might say hey, let me stick a two down there.
Remember, this isn 't a one.
This is a ten, so we have to stick a zero there
to remember that.
So ten times two is twenty.
Or you say one times two is two,
but you 're putting it in the tens place, so you still get twenty.
So ten times two is twenty.
It works out.
Then one times three.
And we have to be very careful.
Let 's get rid of what we had from before.
One times three is three.
There 's nothing to add here, so you just get a three.
And so you get ten times thirty - two is three hundred twenty.
This one right here, that 's a ten.
Ten plus eight is eighteen.
So now we just add up the two numbers.
You add them up.
Six plus zero is six.
Five plus two is seven.
Two plus three is five.
Let 's keep going.
Let 's do ninety - nine times eighty - eight.
That 's going to give us a big number!
Eight times nine is seventy - two.
Stick the seven up there.
And then you have eight times nine again.
Eight times nine is seventy - two, but now you have the seven up here.
So seventy - two plus seven is seventy - nine.
Fair enough.
Now we 're done with this.
Let 's just delete it
just so that we don 't get confused in our next step.
In our next step, we 're going to multiply this eight now times ninety - nine.
But this eight is an eighty.
So let 's stick a zero down there.
Eight times nine is seventy - two.
Stick a seven up there.
Then eight times nine is seventy - two.
Plus seven is seventy - nine.
Two plus zero is two.
Let me switch colors.
Nine plus two is eleven.
Carry the one.
One plus seven is eight.
Eight plus nine is seventeen.
Carry the one.
One plus seven is eight.
Eight thousand seven hundred twelve.
Let 's keep going.
Can 't do enough of these.
All right, fifty - three times seventy - eight.
I think you 're getting the hang of it now.
Let 's multiply eight times fifty - three first.
So eight times three is twenty - four.
Stick the two up there.
Eight times five is forty.
Forty plus two is forty - two.
Now we 're going to have to deal with that seven.
That seven right there, which is really a seventy.
So we got to remember to put the zero there.
Seven times three, and let 's get rid of this.
Don 't want to get confused.
Seven times three is twenty - one.
Put the one there and put the two up here.
Seven times five is thirty - five.
Plus two is thirty - seven.
Now we 're ready to add.
Four plus zero is four.
Two plus one is three.
Four plus seven is eleven.
Carry the one.
One plus three is four.
Four thousand one hundred thirty - four.
Let 's up the stakes a little bit.
So let 's say I had seven hundred ninety - six times fifty - eight.
Let 's mix it up well.
All right, so first we 're just going to multiply eight times seven hundred ninety - six.
And notice, I 've thrown in an extra digit up here.
So eight times six is forty - eight.
Put the four up there.
Eight times nine is seventy - two.
Plus four is seventy - six.
And then eight times seven is fifty - six.
Fifty - six plus seven is sixty - three.
I 'm sure I' ll make a careless mistake
at some point in this video.
And the goal for you is to identify if and when I do.
All right, now we 're ready,
so we can get rid of these guys up here.
Now we can multiply this five, which is in the tens place.
It 's really a fifty.
Times this up here.
Because it 's a fifty we stick a zero down there.
Five times six is thirty.
Put the zero there, put the three up there.
Five times nine is forty - five.
Plus the three is forty - eight.
Five times seven is thirty - five.
Plus four is thirty - nine.
Now we 're ready to add.
Eight plus zero is eight.
Six plus zero is six.
Three plus eight is eleven.
One plus six is seven.
Seven plus nine is sixteen.
And then one plus three is four.
So seven hundred ninety - six times fifty - eight is forty - six thousand one hundred sixty - eight.
And that sounds about right,
because seven hundred ninety - six - - it 's almost eight hundred.
You know, which is almost one thousand.
So if we multiplied one thousand times fifty - eight we 'd get fifty - eight thousand.
But we 're multiplying something a little bit smaller
than one thousand times fifty - eight,
so we 're getting something a little bit smaller than fifty - eight thousand.
So the number is in the correct ballpark.
Now let 's do one more here
where I 'm really going to step up the stakes.
Let 's do five hundred twenty - three times - -
I 'm going to do a three - digit number now.
Times seven hundred ninety - eight.
That 's a big three - digit number!
But it 's the same exact process.
And once you kind of see the pattern
you 'll say, hey, this' ll apply to any number of digits times any number of digits.
It 'll just start taking you a long time
and your chances of making a careless mistake are going to go up,
but it 's the same idea.
So we start with eight times five hundred twenty - three.
Eight times three is twenty - four.
Stick the two up there.
Now eight times two is sixteen.
Sixteen plus two is eighteen.
Put the one up there.
Eight times five is forty.
Plus one is forty - one.
So eight times five hundred twenty - three is four thousand one hundred eighty - four.
We 're not done.
We have to multiply times the ninety and by the seven hundred.
So let 's do the ninety right there.
So it 's a ninety, so we' ll stick a zero there.
It 's not a nine.
And let 's get rid of these guys right there.
Nine times three is twenty - seven.
Nine times two is eighteen.
Eighteen plus two is twenty.
And then we have nine times five is forty - five.
Forty - five plus two is forty - seven.
I don 't want to write it that thick.
Forty - seven.
Let me make sure I did that one right,
and let 's just review it a little bit.
Nine times three was twenty - seven.
We wrote the seven down here and put the two up there.
Nine times two is eighteen.
We added two to that, so we wrote twenty.
Wrote the zero down there and the two up there.
The nine times five was forty - five.
Plus two is forty - seven.
You really have to make sure
that you don 't make careless mistakes with these.
Then finally, we have to multiply the seven,
which is really a seven hundred times five hundred twenty - three.
When it was just an eight we just started multiplying here.
When it was a ninety, when we were dealing with the tens place,
we put a zero there.
Now that we 're dealing with something that' s in the hundreds
we 're going to put two zeros there.
And so you have seven - - and let 's get rid of this stuff.
Seven times three is twenty - one.
Put the one there.
Stick the two up there.
Seven times two is fourteen.
Fourteen plus our two is sixteen.
Put the one up there.
Seven times five is thirty - five.
Plus one is thirty - six.
And now we 're ready to add.
And hopefully we didn 't make any careless mistakes.
So four plus zero plus zero.
That 's easy.
That 's four.
Eight plus seven plus zero.
That 's fifteen.
Carry the one.
One plus one plus one is three.
Four plus seven plus six.
That 's what' s?
Four plus six is ten.
It 's seventeen.
And then we have one plus four is five.
Five plus six is eleven.
Carry the one.
One plus three is four.
So five hundred twenty - three times seven hundred ninety - eight
is four hundred seventeen thousand three hundred fifty - four.
Now we can even check to make sure.
And so this is the moment of truth.
Let 's see if we have - - let' s see,
five hundred twenty - three times seven hundred ninety - eight.
There you go.
Moment of truth.
I don 't have to re - record this video.
It 's four hundred seventeen thousand three hundred fifty - four.
But we did it without the calculator,
which is the important point.

Welcome to this "How to Level a Haas Lathe" video
The leveling procedure has three steps:
first, set the machine at the correct height to accommodate the coolant tank
second, rough level front to back and side to side to promote proper coolant flow
and finally, remove any twist in the base casting so the machine will cut accurately
The tools need for this procedure are:
a ratchet and 3 / 4 "socket
a 1 1 / 2 "Wrench, Tape Measure
and Haas Leveling Tool # T - 2181
An ST - 30 Turning Center is used to show the leveling procedure
but the same principles apply to all the ST Series lathes
Make sure the machine is high enough off the ground to clear the coolant tank
Set each of the four outer leveling screws to 3 1 / 2 "or (90mm)
between the floor and the bottom of the base casting
Once the height has been set
raise the center leveling screws
AND THE RIGHT FRONT SCREW well above the pads
These will all be moved back into position in the final steps of the process
Note that any chip conveyor support screws or brackets should not
be touching the ground until after the leveling procedure is complete
If necessary, move the tailstock or 2nd spindle to the HOME position
Prepare tool T - 2181 by installing the mounting arm onto one of two slots
the 45 - degree slot is for ST Lathes
The other slot is for older SL - Series machines
depending on turret type, place the mounting arm either in an OD tool holder slot
or a slotted VDI tool holder
Be sure to mount tool T - 2181 so that the tool’s surface is level to the ground
and push the tool firmly against the turret face while installing
Jog the turret to the middle of X - axis travel
Then jog the turret along the Z - axis towards the spindle
getting to the end of Z travel if possible
The shorter level vial will be parallel to the Z - axis
and indicates the tilt of the machine from left to right
Tilt along this axis influences how coolant and chips drain from the lathe
Note whether the right side of the machine
needs to be raised or lowered to center the bubble
Using only the RIGHT REAR leveling screw
make adjustments until the bubble is centered
Now, note the reading of the longer precision leveling vial
which is parallel to the turret face
This reading shows the angle of the machine front to back
Check whether the LEFT FRONT leveling screw needs
to be raised or lowered to bring the machine level
Adjust the screw until the bubble is centered in the vial
With the machine now level front to back
and side to side it is time to check for twist in the base casting
Use the precision level vial parallel to the turret for this measurement
With the turret still beside the spindle
note the exact position of the bubble in the vial window
Jog the Z - axis to home position
Now note how far the bubble has moved
The level most likely will tilt down towards the RIGHT FRONT CORNER
since that screw is not touching the cast puck
Raise the right front corner until the indicating bubble has moved to the exact position
established at the spindle side of the machine
After adjusting the leveling screw, wait for at least 10 seconds for the bubble to stabilize
Once settled, move the turret back across full Z - axis travel to the spindle side
and note which direction the level is tilting
If the bubble has not moved from the zero position
the twist has been removed from the base
If another adjustment is needed
bring the bubble back to the center position by raising or lowering
the front corner of the machine, on the side nearest the level
Continue to adjust the leveling screws
until the bubble reads zero at both ends of Z - axis travel
With the twist removed, it is time to lower the middle leveling screws into position
Turn each middle screw and cast puck together
making sure the puck is centered under the screw
When the puck and screw have stopped turning by hand
use the ratchet wrench to tighten the screw an additional 10 degrees of rotation
Don’t tighten any further than 10 degrees
as this will negatively affect the geometry of the machine
Carefully tighten the locking nuts while holding the leveling screws stationary
After tightening the level screw lock nuts, verify with one more pass
along the Z - axis that there is still no twist in the machine
Variation in the bubble reading should not exceed one graduation
Now, carefully remove tool T - 2181 from the turret
The machine is now at the proper height, level and free of any twist
This is the foundation for optimal machine accuracy

We 're asked to multiply 65 times 1.
So literally, we just need to multiply 65 - - we could write
it is a times sign like that or we could write it as a dot
like that - - but this means 65 times 1.
And there 's two ways to interpret this.
could view this as the number 1 sixty - five
But either way, if you have one 65, this is literally just
Anything times 1 is going to be that anything,
Whatever this is times 1 is going to be
that same thing again.
If I have just some kind of placeholder here times 1, and
I could even write it as the times symbol times 1, that 's
going to be that same placeholder.

So if I have 3 times 1, I 'm going to get 3.
If I put - - I don 't know - - 157 times 1, that' ll be 157.

We need to evaluate the limit, as x approaches infinity, of 4x
squared minus 5x, all of that over 1 minus 3x squared.
So infinity is kind of a strange number.
You can 't just plug in infinity and see what happens.
But if you wanted to evaluate this limit, what you might try
to do is just evaluate - - if you want to find the limit as this
numerator approaches infinity, you put in really large numbers
there, and you 're going to see that it approaches infinity.
That the numerator approaches infinity as
x approaches infinity.
And if you put really large numbers in the denominator,
you 're going to see that that also - - well,
not quite infinity.
3x squared will approach infinity, but we 're
subtracting it.
So this is going to be equal to the limit as x approaches
infinity of 4 minus 5 over x over 1 over x squared minus 3.
And what 's this going to be equal to?
Well, as x approaches infinity - - 5 divided by
infinity - - this term is going to be 0.
Super duper infinitely large denominator,
this is going to be 0.
That is going to approach 0.
And same argument.
This right here is going to approach 0.
So this is going to be equal to negative, or 4 over a
negative 3, or negative 4 / 3.
So you didn 't have to do use L' Hopital 's Rule
for this problem.

So welcome to the Lean Launchpad class.
If you 're interested in the logistics on how to take this class,
this lecture zero will describe it. But if you want to just get started,
click on lecture one. So the good news is there 's actually
four ways to watch these lectures:
So a good way is to kind of watch them and use the Udacity
discussion forums to interact with other people watching these lectures.
Something that 's better is, these lectures are free and
they don 't really require any books or text.
But there are books or texts, and I would feel a little guilty
not telling you that Alexander Osterwalder 's "Business Model Generation"
book is kind of the standard for understanding the business model canvas,
and The Startup Owner 's Manual, written by yours truly
and my co - author, Bob Dorf, is kind of the standard for customer development.
But let me emphasize again, these are not required,
and you could understand the lectures just fine without them.
But they certainly help explain a lot of the detail in the
617 pages, because it 's almost an encyclopedia for startups.
Enough of the ad - - that 's the last time I' ll mention buying
the texts or books. Almost best is to actually watch these
lectures, but this time form a startup team and actually
think about - - instead of just sitting in your office or on your
computer - - actually be watching these as you start your company.
Now, the best way to actually watch these lectures
is with facilitators and coaches and mentors.
and the way you can do that is by physically taking the
class with Startup Weekend Next. If you go to the website,
swnext. org, you could find out how to sign up in your city
and town, and participate as a team, with groups of other teams
physically, week to week.
and one of the reasons we kind of suggest that you,
instead of just watching the lectures, actually get out of
the building and do it - - either by yourself or with your team,
or with Startup Weekend - - is startups are not about lectures.
And entrepreneurship is not about your grades,
and this class is about the work you do outside the building
after you watch the lectures, not how much of the lectures you watch.
Entrepreneurship is experiential, it 's hands - on,
and it 's immediate and intense feedback.

Which whole numbers will make this statement true?
We have the statement here where we have some brackets
are less than 7.
So we just have to figure out which whole numbers, if we put
them here, are really less than 7.
So let 's draw a number line and let' s go up to 7.
When we talk about whole numbers, we 're talking about
the non - negative numbers or numbers that start at zero,
and they aren 't fractions.
Let me draw them on a number line.
Let 's say we have this number line right here.
We 'll start at 0.
You could go below 0.
There are negative numbers, but we 're not going to concern
So you have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 - - I 'll go up a little
bit - - 8, 9.
Now we want all of the numbers that are less than 7.
That 's what that means.
We could write it like this.
Question mark is less than 7, and what would satisfy
question mark?
The hardest thing about these greater than or less than is
remembering what the symbol means.
We have the smaller side pointing to the question mark,
so that is the smaller number.
We have the larger side of the symbol pointing to the 7, so 7
is going to be the larger of the two numbers.
So what numbers satisfy that?
Well, anything below 7.
Any whole number below 7.
So if we look at 7 on the number line, what are all of
the whole numbers that are below 7, that are less than 7?
Well, we have a 6, we have 5, we have 4, 3, 2, 1 or 0.
So you could put any of these numbers here and the statement
would be true.
You could write 0 is less than 7.
That 's true.
You could write 3 is less than 7.
That 's true.
You could write 6 is less than 7, and that would be true.
You could not write that 8 is less than 7, so 8 would not
satisfy this.
This is not true.
This is not true, so we cannot write that.

Simplify the rate of cans of soda compared to people.
So this ratio here says that we have 92 cans of soda for
every 28 people.
What we want to do is simplify this, and really just putting
this ratio, or this fraction, in simplest form.
So the best way to do that is just to figure out what is the
largest number, or the largest common factor, of both 92 and
28, and divide both of these numbers by that common factor.
So let 's figure out what it is.
And to do that, let 's just take the prime factorization
of 92, and then we 'll do the prime factorization of 28.
So 92 is 2 times 46, which is 2 times 23.
And 23 is a prime number, so we 're done.
92 is 2 times 2 times 23.
And if we did the prime factorization of 28, 28 is 2
times 14, which is 2 times 7.
So we can rewrite the 92 cans of soda as 2 times 2 times 23
cans of soda for every 2 times 2 times 7 people.
Now, both of these numbers have a 2 times 2 in it, or
they 're both divisible by 4.
That is their greatest common factor.
So let 's divide both the top number and the
bottom number by 4.
So if you divide the top number by 4, or if you divide
it by 2 times 2, it will cancel out right over there.
And then if you do the bottom number divided by 4, or 2
times 2, it will cancel out with that 2 times 2.
And we are left with 23 cans of soda for every 7 people, or
7 people for every 23 cans of soda.
And we 're done!
We 've simplified the rate of cans, or the ratio of cans, of
soda compared to people.
I guess they 're considering this a rate, so maybe they' re
saying how quickly do 7 people consume cans over some period,

A farmer grows 531 tomatoes
and is able to sell 176 of them
in three days.
Given that his supply of tomatoes decreases by 176,
how many tomatoes does he have remaining
at the end of three days?
So he starts with 531 tomatoes
let me give myself a little more space to work with
- - he starts with 531 tomatoes
and he is able to sell 176.
He is essentially going to subtract
the 176 that he is selling.
If we want to figure out
how many he is left with,
we are going to subtract 176.
That‘s how many he sells in three days.
They 're asking us:
how many does he have left at the end of three days?
We just have to subtract those 176
from the amount he grew.
It turned into this straight up subtraction problem.
Lets see if we can do it.
If we go straight to the ones place
right over here
and actually let me do it in parallel
because i think that might be interesting over here.
I 'm going to do it the way
you traditionally do it here on the left
and then I 'm going to show you
what 's happening here on the right.
So 531 is the same thing
as 500 + 30 + 1
and if you subtract 176
that is the same thing as subtracting 100
and subtracting another 70 and subtracting another 6
I wrote it this way
because the 5 in 531 is the same thing as 500
The 3 in 531 is in the tens place
so it 's really representing 30
the 1 in 531 is in the ones place
so it represents one
and now
it 'll be a little bit clearer
what we 're doing
when we 're borrowing or regouping
on this problem right over here
and so let 's start off with the ones place
one is less than 6
It 'd be great if we can regoup some of the value
from the rest of the places
so we can go straight to the tens place
the tens place we can borrow
or regroup ten from it
so if we take ten from here
this becomes 20
we 're going to take that 10 and add it to the 1
so this will become 11
we just added 10
we moved over 10 from the tens place
to the ones place
if you look at it over here
you could say: Look! we 're taking 10 from the 30
that becomes a 20
and then the 1 becomes an 11
the way when I was first in school
people 'd say, "You borrow one
from the three "
and you kind of just stick that one right over here
but what you 're really doing
is you 're taking a 10 from a 30
and making it into a twenty
and you 're getting a - you' re adding the ten to the one
getting 11
but either way you 'll end up with 11
in the ones place
and now you can subtract
11 - 6 is 5
now we go over to the tens place
in the tens place
we now have 2 - 7
which is really representing 20 - 70
well we - thats 70 is bigger than the 20
so we want to add some more
to the tens place
well we can go the hundreds place
to find some more value to regroup
so let 's see if we can do that
we have 500 here
so what happens when we take a hundred from that
so we 're just left with 400 from here
and we take that 100 and we put it in
the tens place
so instead of 20 we now have 120
if you look at it on this problem
since we are using the places here
we 're going to take 100 from the 500
and have 400
and then we 're going to take that 100
that we took and take it to the tens place
well 100 is 10 tens
so we 're going to add 10 to this
so this is going to become a 12
once again, the way -
the kind of more mechanical rope way of thinking about it is that
- oh - you took one away from the four
and you stick that one in front on the two
but you 're really taking a 100 from the 500, making it 400
and then adding that 100 to the 20 here
and making it 120
but your writing here is a 12
because it is 12 tens
you 're at the tens place
so let me write it down
this is the ones place
this is tens place
and this is the hundreds place
so now that our numbers on top in the tens place
is bigger than the numbers on the bottom
we can subtract
so we get 120 - 70 that is 50
or 12 minus 7 is 5
5 is in the tens place
so it 's really representing 50
let me circle it with the same colour
so you recognise that
this 5 is representing 50
then finally we 're in the hundreds place
so 400 - 100 is 300
4 - 1 is 3
but this 3 represents 300
this 5 represents 50
this 5 represents 5
so we 're done
we get 355
the farmer is left with 355 tomatoes
at the end of 3 days
or 300 + 50 + 5 tomatoes.

Human beings have always observed that is you have
an object that is moving,
so this is a moving object,
traveling to the right here,
that it seems to stop on it 's own.
That if you do nothing to this moving object,
on it 's own, this object is going to come to a stop.
It is going to come to rest.
And on the other side of things,
if you want to keep an object moving,
you have to keep applying a force to it.
We 've never in our everyday experience
seen an object that just keeps moving
on and on forever without anyone acting on it.
It seems like something will always stop.
And this is why, for most of human history,
probably pre - history, but we definitely know the ancient Greeks
all the way until the early 1600s,
so for at least 2000 years,
the assumption was "objects have a natural tendency to stop."
Objects... have... tendency... to come to rest or to stop.
And if you want to keep them moving,
you have to apply some type of a net force to it.
And once again, this is completly consistent with
everyday human experience,
this is what we 've all experienced our entire lives.
But then these gentlemen show up in the 1600s,
and you might be surprised to see three gentlemen here,
because this is about Newton 's first law of motion.
And, indead, one of these gentlemen is
Sir Isaac Newton.
That 's Newton right over there [middle].
But these other too guys get at least as much credit for it
because they actually described really what
Newton 's first Law describes,
and they did it before Newton.
This is Galileo.
And this is Rene Descarts.
And they describe it in different ways,
and Newton frankly get 's the credit for it
because he really encapsulates into a broader framework
with his other Laws, and the Laws of Gravitation,
which was really the basics of classical mechanics,
and seem to describe, at least until the 20th Century,
most of how reality actually worked.
And their big insight, and it was very unintuitive at the time,
{so now we come to the 1600s}
Is that these three gentlemen said,
maybe it works the other way.
Maybe objects have a tendency to maintain their velocity, their speed and their direction.
And if their speed is zero, they 'll maintain that restfulness.
Unless they 're acted upon by an unbalanced force.
So the completly opposite way of thinking.
For over 2000 years, objects tend to stop on their own,
if you want to keep the movement, apply a force.
These guys say,
Objects hava tendency to maintain their motion forever
and the only way that your going to stop them is
if you act on it, or accelerate them, or change their velocity,
so either their speed or direction some way,
is to act on them with an unbalanced force.
But you might be saying,
Hey, come on Sal, what 's going on?
You just went through this,
you said for most of most of human history,
including my own personal history,
this is what I observed [top right].
How can these guys say that this thing has a tendency to
go on forever?
This seems to break down.
And their big insight was,
well, maybe these things don 't have, by themselves,
a tendency to stop, but because of interactions
with their enviorment, forces are being generated
that are acting against their motion.
So when you think you 're leaving this thing alone,
there is actualy a net force that is trying to stop it.
And in this particular example over here,
the net force is the force of friction.
It 's the interaction between the block and the ground.
So, when you think you 're leaving this thing alone,
you actually have a net force going against it 's motion,
which is the force of friction.
And these guys realize that,
because they said,
look, if it was an innate property of the block,
regardelss of the enviornment,
it should kind of always come to a stop
in maybe a similar way.
But they saw, if you made this surface a little bit smoother
this thing would travel further and further.
Maybe if you eliminated this friction,
if you made this surface completely friction - less,
completely smooth, this thing indead would travel forever.
And they didn 't have the luxury of launching satilites,
and doing things in deep space,
so it was a very, very unintuitive thought experiment.
And you might say, what about this other thing,
what happens when I am applying the force?
Becuase in my everyday life,
If I want to drag my TV set across the room
I apply a force to it.
And what these guys would tell you
is all you were doing,
if you were keeping the velocity of that TV constant,
all you were doing was counteracting this net negative force.
So if this was a TV dragging across your carpet,
this is the force of friction acting against the motion
of the object,
and so you are essentially just balancing it when you push it.
If you balance it perfectly,
you will be able to maintain it 's velocity.
If you want to accelerate it,
you will have to apply even more force in the direction you are actually moving it.
Many thanks to Sal!:)

Control
Haas Control
New Graphical User Interface
My name is John Nelson with Haas Automation
We have created this video to introduce you to the new graphical user interface
That will be appearing on selected Haas machines beginning in October of 2007
Graphical user interface is a fancy term for new screen layout
What we have done with the new screens is reorganize them into three general modes
To give users access to every control feature needed in that mode without having to leave the current display screen
The three modes are “Set - Up”, “Operation”, and “Edit”
Along the way we added many new features and enhancements, so lets get started with our introduction
The keypad has not changed at all and virtually every key performs its same function as before
While the screens look very different, the control works very much the same
So to begin, I press [RESET] to clear the alarms and [POWER UP / RESTART] to home the machine
Notice at the top of the screen, that we are immediately in “Setup” mode and the active function is Zero Return
Handle Jog is also a function within “Setup” mode
so to begin, I’ll press the [HAND JOG] key and I am ready to begin setting up my offsets
Let’s take a look around the screen at the different boxes of information
The active “Program” box is displayed in the upper left
The tool offsets are displayed to the right
Below the tool offsets are the work zero offsets
Along the bottom, we have the spindle information box
with the override values for spindle speed, feed rate, and rapid rate
Next to that is the “Position” box showing operator, work offset, machine, and distance - to - go coordinates
Here, to the right, is the “Tool Management” information
Below is where status messages like “Single Block” and “Block Delete” are displayed
Along the bottom, in the old familiar place, is the data input box
Notice the “Tool Offset” box is white and the rest of the boxes are colored
This signals that the focus is on the “Tool Offsets” box
Pressing the arrow keys immediately begins moving the cursor around this box
I put the cursor on the length offset for tool 1
Press the [TOOL OFFSET MEASURE] key
And my first tool is set
I press the [NEXT TOOL] key, same as always, and I’m ready to go with tool 2
In previous versions of the Haas control, if I wanted to go to the work zero offsets, I would press the [OFFSET] key
It’s the same with the new control
Now when I press the [OFFSET] key
The focus changes to the “Work Zero Offset” box
And I scroll around this box to set my offsets
Both offset boxes look very much the same as before
Except that we have added this column for tool type in the “Tool Offset” box
You have the ability to define your cutters as one of five tool types
The available types are
Drill
Tap
Shell Mill
End Mill
and Spot Drill
Another feature added to the control is the ability to sort offsets
By pressing the [F3] key with the focus on an offset screen
You can sort all the offsets by whichever column the cursor is on
For example, if you move the cursor over to the “Tool Type” column and press [F3]
The control will display the tool offsets in order by the tool type
This will come in handy when you need to look at all the different drills you have in the machine
The final change to the tool offset display is the addition of the “Pocket - Tool” table here in the “Tool Offset” box
Before we move on to the next screen, note that I can jog the machine axis without leaving the display
Well, I’ve got my offsets set now so I need to load my program
I press the same button as always, [LIST PROG]
Notice, at the top of the screen, I am now in “Edit” mode and List is the active function
The “List Program” screen now has tabs to navigate the different devices connected to the machine
The program I want is on my USB memory stick
So I connect it to the machine
Watch the control recognize it
Cursor over to the "USB Device" and press the [WRITE / ENTER] key
It displays all the files on my USB memory stick
If I wanted to load several files, I could press the [WRITE / Enter] key when the files I want are highlighted
and the control marks those files with a check mark
Now, the next function I select like Delete or Copy will happen to all the marked files
I only want to copy this one program, so I’m going to press the [UNDO] key to remove the checkmarks
I press the [F2] key to bring up the “Copy To” dialog box
I highlight the device I want to copy the program to
In this case “Memory”
And press the [WRITE / ENTER] key
For a complete list and description of all the functions of list programs and file navigation
Press the [HELP CALC] key to access the quick - key help menu
We have the command name, the associated key for each function
And at the bottom of the menu is a full description of how to perform each function
There are now extensive quick - key help menus from many screens in the new control
I need to make a quick change to my program so I will press the [EDIT] key like I have always done
Notice along the top of the screen, I am in “Edit” mode and Edit is the function
This area of the screen has changed quite a bit so let’s look around
Here, in the upper - left corner is the active “Program Edit” box
Notice this note in the title bar
“Cycle start to simulate”
In “Edit”, I can press [CYCLE START] to go directly to graphics mode and run a program
And now we have the ability to speed up and slow down the graphics processing speed with the [F3] and [F4] keys
I press [RESET] to go back to “Edit” mode
Over here, to the right, I have the program list
I press [EDIT] one more time and the focus changes to this side of the screen
I scroll to select a second program I want to edit
And that program is available for editing
Down here in the lower - left corner, I have the "Editor Help" box
When I press [F1], I get the advanced editor like I used to
As I scroll around the topics in the advanced editor
The help description for each topic is displayed in the "Edit" help box
We now have a viewable clipboard in the bottom - right side of the "Edit" screen
Any time you cut or copy a selection to the clipboard, it will be displayed in the "Clipboard" box
You can also use this as a storage area for text or code commands that you repeatedly paste into your programs
The third function under the "Edit" mode is MDI
When I press the [MDI] key, I get the same manual data input screen as before
One press of the [PRGRM CONVRS] key toggles me between this box
and the Visual Quick Code Programming system and the Intuitive Programming System
if they are activated on this machine
Our final mode is "Operation" mode
As you might well guess, I enter "Operation" mode by pressing the [MEM] key
In "Operation" mode, we have all the information needed to run the machine organized and available for access
Again, the upper - left corner is the "Program" display box
While executing programs that run sub - programs
both the main program and the sub program will be displayed in a split - screen box
Next are the active G - codes with text descriptions
Coolant level indicator
And the active tool information including the graphic image of the tool type taken from the "Tool Offset" page
In the center of the screen is the offset window
This box is ready for any offset adjustment while the machine is running
I don’t have to exit this screen to change an offset
Along the bottom, we have the spindle information box with the override display
In the center is the "Position" display box
And to the right, "Timers and Counters"
As an experienced machinist, one of my favorite new features is this little display here
This is titled “Remaining”
The "Remaining" timer uses the information from the "Last Cycle" timer to display the time remaining in a program
In a production environment, this will allow the operator to know how much time is remaining in the cycle
and make better time - management decisions when leaving the machine
Now, let’s go back to the keypad
Every button on the left side of the keypad performs the exact same function in the exact same way
with the exception of [F3] and [F4]
[F3] now slows down the speed of the graphics and [F4] speeds up the graphics
Obviously, there has been no change to the function of the letter keys and the number keys
as well as the cursor navigation keys
So that leaves displays
When I press the [PRGRM / CONVERS] key
The focus changes to the active program box
When I press the [POSIT] key, the focus changes to the "Position" display box
More presses toggle through the four position displays just like previous versions of the Haas control
Pressing the [OFFSET] key changes the focus to the "Offset" box
And successive presses toggles between the "Tool Offsets" and the "Work Zero Offsets"
Pressing the [CURNT COMDS] key displays the "Macro Variables" page
And pressing [PAGE UP] or [PAGE DOWN] from here toggles through the same pages as before
The new user settable "Operation Timers and Set - Up" page has been added to current commands
This page allows you to reset your timers and counters as before
but also allows you to monitor the value of up to two macro variables at the same time
You can enter a custom name for the variable
the variable number
and the control will always display the value of that variable
There is no change to the alarm message display other than the added quick - key help screens
The last key is the [HELP CALC] key
We have re - grouped the Help and Calculator functions into the tab format
Under "Help", we have sub - tabs for "G - Code" and "M - Code" lists
"Features", which is a quick overview of the topics covered in this video
and "Index"
The "Index" sub - tab is a wealth of information on the Haas control and should be read before operating the machine
Along with the "Help" tab, there is the "Drill Table" tab, which is a tap / drill chart, and the "Calculator" tab
As you can see, the look of the Haas control has changed quite a bit
In reality, the operation of the machine
and how the user performs functions on the machine has not changed much at all
We realize change can be difficult
but we believe after a short time working with this new Haas control, you will be hooked
and realize that the most user - friendly machine tool control in the world just got much better

An electrician has the following lengths of cable: 23
inches, 49 inches, and 8 feet.
How much cable does he have in Feet?
So these are the lengths.
Each of these are the length of a cable in
inches, inches, and feet.
And we want to know the total length, if you add all of
these up, and we need the total length in feet.
And so the best way to do that is to convert each of these
lengths into feet, and then add them all up.
So let 's start with this one right over here: 23 inches.
So it 's always important to have your intuition give a
little bit of a check on what the answer should look like.
There are many inches per foot, so when you convert this
into feet, you should have a smaller number.
There are 12 inches per foot.
So this should be a small number.
This is not even 2 feet.
24 inches would be 2 feet.
So this should be less than 2 feet.
But let 's do it mathematically.
So to do it mathematically, we want this inches to cancel out
with inches.
And the way you do that, is you put that in the
denominator.

So it cancels out with the inches.
And so we want feet per inches, or foot per inches.
I guess I 'll just write ft.
It could be feet or foot, singular or
plural, it doesn 't matter.
So how many feet are there per inches?
Or another way to think about it, how many inches
are there per foot?
1 foot is equal to 12 inches, or you could say 1 foot for
every 12 inches, or you could read this as 1 / 12
of a foot per inch.
Either way, if we multiply this, the inches cancel out.
That 's why we know, at least mathematically, if we just did
it mechanically, why we shouldn 't multiply by 12.
But also it should make complete sense.
We should be dividing by 12 because when you express this
distance in feet, it should be a smaller number, so we should
divide by 12.
So what does this give us?
This is equal to 23 times 1 is 23 / 12.
This inches cancels out with that inches, and we 're just
left with feet.
So that is 23 / 12 feet.
And this is an improper fraction, but I 'll leave it as
an improper fraction for now because they 're actually
easier to manipulate than mixed numbers.
So that 's that first cable.
Let 's do the second one right here: 49 inches.
So the second cable is 49 inches, and
we do the same thing.
We want to convert it to feet.
We have inches in the denominator.
We should end up dividing by something because we want a
smaller number.
49 inches will be a smaller number of feet
by a factor of 12.
So what we care about is feet per inches, and we know that
there is 1 foot for every 12 inches, or 1 / 12
of a foot per inch.
It can be read either way.
When you multiply, the inches will cancel out, and we will
be left with 49 times 1, which is 49, over 12 feet.
That is the second cable.
And then we have this last cable right
here, this 8 - foot cable.
The very last one is 8 feet, and if we want, we can convert
that into an improper fraction.
At this point, there 's two ways we can do it.
Everything is in feet.
Here, it 's improper fractions.
We could, if we want, convert these into mixed numbers and
then add them up, or we can convert this into an improper
fraction that has the same denominator, and
then add them up.
And the easiest way, I think, is to just have this with the
denominator 12.
So 8 feet is the same thing as what over 12?
Well, what 's 8 times 12?
It 's 96, right?
96 divided by 12 is 8.
8 is the same thing as 96 / 12.
These are equivalent.
Let me make sure this 8 and 96 / 12 is the exact same thing.
I picked 12 because these have 12 in the denominator.
And then I said, 12 times 8 is 96.
So 8 feet is the same thing as 96 / 12 feet.
And now I can add everything up.
The total length of cable he has is - - I 'll do it over here.
It 's 96 / 12 plus 23 / 12 plus 49 / 12, and everything is in
feet, so this answer will give us in feet.
We have all of the same denominators.
Our denominator is 12.
And so our numerator 's going to be 96 plus 23 plus 49.
Let 's add that up over here.
So 96, 23, 49, we have to add it up.
6 plus 3 is 9.
9 plus 9 is 18.
1 plus 9 is 10.
10 plus 2 is 12.
12 plus 4 is 16.
So that 's 168.
So this expression right here is equal to 168 / 12, which is a
valid answer.
And, of course, all of these are in feet,
so it 's 168 / 12 feet.
But let 's write this now as a mixed number, so that we have
a better idea of really how many feet it is.
And to do that, we just divide 168 by 12.
So 12 goes into 168.
It doesn 't go into 1.
It goes into 16 exactly one time.
1 times 12 is 12.
We subtract.
16 minus 12 is 4.
Bring down the 8.

12 goes into 48 four times.
4 times 12 is 48.
And we have no remainder.
So 168 / 12 is exactly 14, so this is
exactly equal to 14 feet.
So our electrician has exactly 14 feet of cable.


Alright, so I’ve redrawn the graph from the previous
examples just to make a little bit more room and
what we’ve got so far is the original graph and the –
a tree version of the graph that we built by search,
some kind of data depth - first, breadth - first – any kind
of search actually will do, as long as we now have
these green edges pointing downward and these red
no - tree edges connecting nodes that need to be
connected if the edge wasn’t actually part of this
tree. Then we post ordered the nodes and now what
do we do next. We now compute the number of
descendents for each node in the graph and the
number of descendents is the number of nodes that
are either the node or reachable from the node by
following green edges only. So this is easiest to start
at the bottom here, F has just the node itself and no
descendants, so it’s got a number of descendant of
one, same thing with G. E has one descendant, one
descendent plus itself for three. D has the three
descendants of E plus itself for four. C has the four
descendants of D plus itself is five. B has just itself
and A has B’s descendants, C’s descendants plus
itself for seven. So the next thing we’re going to
compute is for each of the nodes, we’re going to
consider the set of nodes that are descendants of
the node or reachable from the descendants of the
node by one hop of a non - tree edge and of all those
nodes that are reachable, we’re going to look at the
post - order value that is the smallest, we’ll call that L.
So in the case of F, F has itself and it also can reach
G, the smallest value there is two. G has no
descendants but it can reach by one red edge F. So
the smallest least values two and three is two. E has
F and G and itself that it can reach no other nodes
by non - tree edges and the smallest of those
numbers is two. D can reach all of these nodes in
itself but also by a non - tree edge it can reach this
node and the smallest of those numbers is one. C
can reach all of these nodes and through one of
those nodes one tree edge gets it to one. B values
itself as one so that’s going to be the smallest. And
A includes everything, so that’s going to include the
one, so that’ll be the smallest. H is the same idea
except of those that same set that we computed for
L, we want to know the largest value. For G between
F and G the largest value is three. For E between E,
F and G the largest value is four. For D, D, E, F, G
and B reachable by a red edge, the largest value is
itself five. C same set for adding in C now and the
largest value becomes six and A set contains
everybody so that’s going to include itself with the
value of seven. Alright, now we’ve decorated these
nodes with lots of interesting numbers, now we can
get to the last step. So given all these nicely
decorated nodes, we now have a rule for figuring out
which ones are the bridge edges and this is the rule.
All the bridge edges are ones that are green, they
have to be three edges and the green number is
less or equal black number and the red number is
bigger than the blue number minus the black
number or in words the – each value has to be less
or equal to the post order value, the lowest value
has to be bigger than the number of descendants
minus the post order value. So apart from the fact
that it’s not immediately obvious why this is the right
rule let’s apply it to the tree to see what gets picked
out. So, what we’re doing here is we’re looking at
each green edge and we’re checking the numbers
on the downward part of the edge. So here is a
green edge and let’s look at the numbers here and
see if they fit the pattern. We need the green
number to be less or equal to the black number. So
that doesn’t work, right. Here is another green edge.
You need the green number to be less or equal to
the black number, oh that works. So the red number
needs to be bigger than the difference between the
black and the blue. So black and the blue the
difference is two. The red number is two, so that
doesn’t work. Alright next edge to check is this one,
so we need to check is green less or equal to black,
yes. Is red bigger than black minus blue? Two is
bigger than one, so yes. So this edge has been
identified as a tree edge. That’s the right answer and
none of the other edges are tree edges but let’s just
check them just to be sure. For this edge, we have –
we need green to be less or equal to black which we
have. And we need red to be bigger than the
difference between blue and black but one is not
bigger than one, so this edge is out. How about this?
We need green less or equal to black, yes. We need
red bigger than the difference, no. Green number is
five because the D node is reachable by a non - tree
edge. Alright, so green less or equal to black, no.
Alright, well that’s it. Those are all the edges. So in
this example anyway the one edge that the
algorithm finds is exactly the bridge edge. Can we
get a handle on why this works? It seems kind of
magic at this point.

I 'm going to do a couple of lattice multiplication examples in this video,
and in the next one we 'll try to understand why it worked.
Let 's say we' re trying to multiply twenty - seven times forty - eight.
What you do is you write down your twenty - seven.
The two and the seven are going to get separate columns
and you write your forty - eight down the right - hand side,
and then you draw a lattice.
This is why it 's called lattice multiplication.
So the two is going to get its own column.
The seven is going to get its own column.
The four is going to get its own row,
and the eight is going to get its own row.
Now the fun thing about lattice multiplication
is you get to do all of your multiplication at one time,
and then you can finish up the problem with all your addition.
You don 't have to keep switching gears by carrying and all of that.
Although there is carrying,
but it 's all while you' re doing the addition step.
So we 're almost done with our lattice.
We actually have to draw these diagonals here.
We 'll understand in the next video why these diagonals even work.
Just like that.
And now we 're ready to multiply.
Seven times four is twenty - eight.
Seven times four is equal to twenty - eight.
So you write down a two and an eight just like that.
Two times four is equal to eight.
So you write down a zero, eight, just like that.
Then you have seven times eight.
Seven times eight is equal to fifty - six.
So we write down a five and a six.
And then finally, two times eight is equal to sixteen.
You write down a one and a six, just like that.
And we 're done with all of our multiplying.
Now we 're ready to add.
So what you do is you go down these diagonals that I drew here.
So this first diagonal, which is really the ones diagonal, you just have a six sitting here.
So you write a six just like that.
Then we move over to the next diagonal.
This diagonal with the six, five, and eight in it.
That 's our tens diagonal.
So eight plus five is thirteen.
Thirteen plus six is nineteen.
So you write your nine right here in the tens place,
and now you carry the one in nineteen up there into the hundreds place,
because this isn 't just nineteen, it' s actually one hundred ninety.
It 's nineteen tens.
Anyway, you carry your one.
You have one plus two is three.
Three plus eight is eleven.
Eleven plus one is twelve.
You write the two in your hundreds place
and you carry the one into your thousands place.
One plus zero is one,
so you just have a one in your thousands place, just like that.
And you get our answer.
Twenty - seven times forty - eight is equal to one thousand two hundred ninety - six.
Let 's do a harder problem.
One that requires more digits, just to show that this will work for any problem.
Let 's say we had five thousand four hundred seventy - nine times - -
let 's do a three - digit number - -
Times seven hundred eighty - seven.
So just like we did in the last time, we make four columns.
One for the five, the four, the seven, and the nine.
We 'll have five thousand four hundred seventy - nine
and then times seven hundred eighty - seven.
So they each get their own row.
Seven hundred eighty - seven.
Looks like that.
Then we have to draw our lattice.
Draw the lattice.
Each of these guys get their own column.
Draw the columns just like that.
And then each one of these characters get their own row.
One row for the seven.
One row for the eight.
One row for this other seven.
Then we have to draw the diagonals.
Draw it like that.
One diagonal, two diagonals,
three diagonals, four diagonals.
I think you get the idea.
And then we have just one, two more diagonals.
We 're ready to multiply now.
So it 's nine times seven.
I won 't do it on the side here.
We know our times tables.
Nine times seven is sixty - three.
Seven times seven is forty - nine.
Four times seven is twenty - eight.
Five times seven is thirty - five.
Let me switch colors arbitrarily.
Nine times eight is seventy - two.
Seven times eight is fifty - six.
Four times eight is thirty - two.
Five times eight is forty.
I 'll switch colors again.
Nine times seven - - we saw that before.
It 's sixty - three.
Seven times seven is forty - nine.
Four times seven is twenty - eight.
And then five times seven is thirty - five.
We 're done with all of our multiplying.
Now we can switch our brains into addition mode.
Let me find a nice suitable color for addition.
Maybe a pink will do for addition.
So we start at our ones place.
Just have a three there, so you write the three in your ones place.
You go to the tens place.
Two plus six is eight.
Eight plus nine is seventeen.
Write the seven in the tens place, carry the one into the hundreds place.
I wrote a one really small here.
One plus three is four.
Four plus seven is eleven.
Eleven plus six is seventeen.
Seventeen plus four is twenty - one.
Twenty - one plus eight is twenty - nine.
Write the nine in the hundreds place and carry the two.
Two plus six is eight.
Eight plus nine is seventeen.
Seventeen plus five is twenty - two.
Twenty - two plus two is twenty - four.
Twenty - four plus two is twenty - six.
Twenty - six plus five is thirty - one.
Carry the three.
Three plus four is seven.
Seven plus eight is fifteen.
Fifteen plus three is eighteen.
Eighteen plus zero is eighteen.
Eighteen plus three is twenty - one.
Write the one, carry the two.
Two plus two is four.
Four plus five is nine.
Nine plus four is thirteen.
Write the three, carry the one.
One plus three is four.
And we 're done!
It 's that easy.
Well, there 's two advantages here.
One is, we got to do all of our multiplication at once.
And then we got to do all of our addition at once.
The other advantage is it 's kind of neat and clean.
When you just do it the traditional way with carrying and number places,
it takes up a lot of space.
But notice, we did our whole problem in a nice, neat and clean area like that
and we got our answer.
Our answer is four million three hundred eleven thousand nine hundred seventy - three.
There you go.
Now in the next video, we are going to try to understand why this worked.

So it 's pretty clear that if you were raising around to capital, going to friends and family
or crowdfunding like Kickstarter or angel capital or venture capital or corporate partners,
all kind of make sense for financing.
Also, going to the small business administration or getting SBIR grants
also fit into the financing column.
But for operating capital that is money you need when your company is an ongoing concern
in generating revenue - - well, lease lines make sense, factoring, vendor financing.
And what 's really interesting is you might also get operating capital from government grants as well
and corporate partners that are also fit there.
So there 's two actually went into the correct category.
Well, surprisingly of course venture capital always does follow on rounds
so this was kind of a trick question.
You could always get more operating capital in subsequent rounds
from venture capitalist, not on the corporate partners.
Just remember that VCs will invest more money to get more ownership of your company.

With this algorithm in hand, we can actually do some useful analysis
beyond just discovering things about the size of the components.
So what I 'm going to ask you to do is to take the code that I wrote
and see if you can call it in a way that will answer this question.
We 're given a graph G that includes a node v1 and a node v2.
We want to call mark _ component
and use that to discover whether or not there is some path - - even if we don 't know what it is - -
but some path that takes us from v1 through the graph to v2.

So for teller sales, I thought the best answer was toner.
Now, for retail, I thought the best answer was PC 's. For VARs, turnkey video editing systems.
And for direct sales, insurance has been sold that way for the last 100 years.
And for system integrators, putting together a telecommunications network is their expertise.

The heavy water reactor will use about 0. 7 percent of the uranium 's energy value, and
the light water reactor will use about half of one percent. They both do terrible.
At normal pressures, water will boil at 100 degrees Celsius. This isn 't nearly hot enough
to generate electricity effectively. So water cooled reactors have to run at over 70 atmospheres
of pressure. You have to build a water cooled reactor as a pressure vessel. The number one
accident people worry about...
Pressure is lost, water that 's being held at 300 degrees Celsius [makes splashing sound]
flashes to steam. Its volume increases roughly by a factor of 1000. If you don 't get emergency
coolant to the fuel in the reactor, it can overheat and melt.
This is what drives the design of this building. If this happens, all the steam is captured
in this building.
The reactors we have today use uranium oxide as a fuel. It 's a ceramic material, chemically
stable, but not very good at transferring heat. If you lose pressure, you lose your
water, and soon your fuel will melt down and release the radioactive fission products within
it.
So they have a series of emergency systems designed to always keep the core covered with
water. We saw the failure of this at Fukushima Daiichi. They had multiple backup diesel generators,
and each one probably had a very high probability of turning on. The tsunami came and knocked
them all out.
People always say "Is nuclear energy safe?", and the first thing I say is "Which one?"
There are thousands of different ways to do nuclear energy. Is a car safe? Well, which
one?
I had the good fortune to learn about a different form of nuclear power.
The liquid fluoride thorium reactor.
We can fully burn up the thorium in this reactor versus only burning up part of the uranium
in a typical light water reactor.
It 's not based on water cooling and it doesn' t use solid fuel. It 's based on fluoride salts
as a nuclear fuel. You have to heat them up to about 400 degrees Celsius to get them to
melt, but that 's actually perfect for trying to generate power in a nuclear reactor. Here' s
the real magic - they don 't have to operate at high pressure. They don' t have to use water
for coolant and there 's nothing in the reactor that' s going to make a big change in density.
Unlike the solid fuels that can melt down if you stop cooling them, these liquid fluoride
fuels are already melted.
In normal operation, you have a little piece of frozen salt that you 've kept frozen by
blowing cool gas over the outside of the pipe. If there 's an emergency and you lose all of
the power to your nuclear power plant, the little blower stops blowing, the frozen plug
of salt melts, and the liquid fluoride fuel inside the reactor drains out of the vessel
through the line and into another tank called a drain tank.
In water cooled reactors, you generally have to provide power to the plant to keep the
water circulating and to prevent a meltdown. But if you lose power to the LFTR, it shuts
itself down all by itself without human intervention.
A staggeringly impressive level of safety, even if there is physical damage to the reactor.
Thorium is a naturally occurring nuclear fuel that is four times more common in the earth 's
crust than uranium. It 's so energy dense that you can hold a lifetime supply of thorium
energy in the palm of your hand. We could use thorium about 200 times more efficiently
than we 're using uranium now. Because the LFTR is capable of almost completely releasing
the energy in thorium, this reduces the waste generated over uranium by factors of hundreds,
and by factors of millions over fossil fuels.
We 're still going to need liquid fuels for vehicles and machinery, but we can generate
these liquid fuels from the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and from water, much like
nature does. We could generate hydrogen by splitting water and combining it with carbon
harvested from CO2 in the atmosphere, making fuels like methanol, ammonia, and dimethyl
ether, which could be a direct replacement for diesel fuels.
Imagine carbon neutral gasoline and diesel, sustainable and self - produced.
You can see that uranium - 235 is on par with silver and platinum. Can you imagine burning
platinum for energy? And that 's what we' re doing with our nuclear energy sources today,
we 're burning this extremely rare stuff, and we' re not burning thorium.
Some people are kind of environmentalists, and they say "Listen, nuclear power is not
sustainable. We 're going to run out of uranium. "OK, I will yield that point to you, if we' re
talking about today 's nuclear technology. In 2007 we used 5 billion tons of coal, 31
billion barrels of oil, and 5 trillion cubic meters of natural gas, along with 65, 000 tons
of uranium to produce the world 's energy.
I have a friend who 's trying to start a rare earth mine in Missouri. "Jim, how much thorium
do you think you 'll be pawing up a year? "And he goes," I think about 5, 000 tons. "5, 000
tons of thorium would supply the planet with all of its energy for a year. And he goes
"And there 's like a zillion other places on earth that are just like my mine. It' s a nice
mine, but it 's not unique, it' s not like this is the one place on earth where this is found. "
Every time mankind has been able to access a new source of energy, it has led to profound
societal implications. Human beings had slaves for thousands and thousands of years. When
we learned how to make carbon our slave, instead of other human beings, we started to learn
how to be able to be civilized people.
Thorium has a million times the energy density of a carbon - hydrogen bond. What could that
mean for human civilization? Because we 're not going to run out of this stuff. We will
never run out. It is simply too common.
On our Facebook page, the gender demographic is about 87 percent male, 13 percent female.
I have never been a proponent for nuclear energy. It 's because of the consumption, right?
It allows us to continuously consume that I believe is unsustainable.
Do you think other forms of energy will prevent us from consuming as much?
If we 're running out of it, yes. I think we will start to ration it and re - use things
as opposed to just creating a new one.
What about solar and wind then? The sun will always shine, the wind will always blow.
Those give us life support.
Thin gruel of a diet of energy.
Yeah. I believe we don 't really appreciate what we have, and I only speak for myself.
So you intuitively perceive wind and solar as being energy sources that are not on the
same par with like oil and gas.
In the scope that we 're currently using them, and I think that if we amplify the scope of
both wind and solar, then we 're also going to be looking at a larger destruction as well.
So you recognize that wind and solar are environmentally invasive forms of energy generation? They
take up a lot of area.
Yeah.
In order to prevent unacceptable levels of environmental destruction limit how much wind
and solar we put in.
We 'll have to use them in different ways incorporating them within already existing structures.
I actually looked at this with my own home. If I covered the house with solar panels how
much would I make and the problem was it wasn 't nearly enough. Their performance went down.
Every single time I go on the roof to clean the solar panels I 'll be putting my life at
risk.
We have roofers, we have people that do that professionally.
My brother 's a roofer. It' s a rough job. That 's why a 21 - year - old like him was out roofing
roofs and making big money because he was putting his life at risk, just like the coal
miners.
You perceive it as a good thing to constrain energy supply right?
Yeah. I do.
Going to a low energy lifestyle will almost certainly correlate to going to a lower - quality - of - life
lifestyle.
While efficiency is worthy of being pursued and we could probably all knock 25 percent
of our energy consumption out, that 's not nearly enough to eliminate the need for fossil
fuels.
Elizabeth May, you know, she may be saying, and I would probably agree with her, "We should
pursue more energy efficient lifestyles, "absolutely.
When you came to debate oil sands / tar sands development in Calgary, you set up sort of
an expectation on what would be acceptable. You said certain return on energy efficiency.
Some nuclear technologies that I think are quite promising, liquid fluoride thorium reactor.
Our policy is very simple to understand, no nuclear.
Is there more nuance demanded there? Concerns about nuclear energy can be addressed with
future technologies?
Since the Greens have a policy against nuclear energy, would we ever reconsider with some
of the new technologies which are being discussed but don 't yet exist? I guess the answer is,
of course.
If Greens globally found some reason to re - assess nuclear, but we only have a limited amount
of money. You want to reduce green house gases. So you want to apply the dollars in ways that
reduce the green house gases the most while creating the most employment possible for
that investment.
We waste 60 percent of all the energy that 's used in Canada. And that' s because of inefficient
building and transportation design. Our infrastructure is designed for cheap and abundant energy.
So, no surprise, there 's lots and lots of waste. What you want to do is improve productivity
with which we use energy.
When you look through the whole hierarchy of choices and options that we have and we
have a long list of options that work quite well, nuclear energy is down the list because
it 's not terribly reliable, it' s hugely expensive capital cost, very few jobs created and it
only produces electricity. It 's about 14 years from when you project forward to when it' s
built and it 's famous for cost overruns. The risk of accidents, long lived nuclear waste
that has to be kept out of the biosphere for a quarter of a million years. The risk of
nuclear proliferation for use in military terms, you don 't even have to look at those
issues for nuclear to fail.
We should pursue more energy efficient lifestyles, absolutely. How far can we go, though? Will
it be enough to make it so that we don 't need to have better and newer forms of energy generation?
I don 't think so. I don' t think even close.
You don 't see wind and solar as...
We have been trying to put solar and wind online for decades. It is still on the order
of about one percent of total energy production in the United States. Wind is quoted in terms
of its capacity. Like you 'll say this is a three megawatt windmill. If I have a 3, 000
megawatt nuclear plant, 1000 of these windmills are equivalent to one of these. The wind is
only blowing about 15 percent of the time, one out of six.
That correlation becomes absolutely meaningless now, because one is running all the time and
the other one is only running one out of six times. If you had a car and you thought "I 'm
going to go out and get in my car and turn the ignition, and I have a one in six chance
the car 's going to turn on. "How useful would that car be to you? The wind industry says,
"That 's OK, Chelsea, you need to have six cars." Energy is all about reliability.
Can we address those concerns by using batteries which are making great advances with nothing
more than a laptop?
It 's a very, very expensive proposition to use battery backup for the grid. It has not
ever been able to be accomplished on a grid level before because of how much it costs
to store a watt hour in a battery.
You 're not even looking at lithium - ion, you' re looking at cheap batteries. You know, you 're
looking at like lead - acid, really cheap batteries. Because you need a lot of them. It 's better
to get a bunch of lousy ones than to get a few really good ones.
If we had a high - conducting or... what do you call them?
Superconducting?
Intermittent power from multiple sources.
If you want to make a power transmission line, you want to make the economic case pay off
for you. You have to show how electricity is going to be thrown into that line almost
all the time. Otherwise, it 's not worth building, it costs too much money.
So the idea that "OK, there 's going to be a wind farm here, there' s going to be a solar
array here, and there 's going to be a wind farm over here, and one of these three at
any time will be working, but we 'll have power transmission lines to all of them. "I mean
that 's just nonsensical. People who propose that haven' t run the numbers.
People don 't want to see power plants and power transmission lines. They will fight
tooth and nail against power transmission lines. We need to have a reliable energy source
that is close to where the energy is needed to be consumed.
I know how you can get more women on board.
OK.
Go on Oprah.
Oh! How could I get in her book club?
Many of you have been part of a class in nuclear science and the politics surrounding that.
Thank you so much for joining me today.
Thank you very much, Kiki, I 'm glad to be here.
Hey, you guys are a pretty techy group, right?
There was a sign that was talking about what hacking was about. There 's such a thing as
nuclear hacking.
I 'm very glad to be here with you today and be a part of this discussion.
The answer is energy cheaper than from coal.
All sorts of things that give us the advantage and they 're all based on energy.
Based upon the assumption that we 're willing to only sacrifice 160 million people' s lives
to sea rise, climate change, and so forth, then January 2011, we need to start reducing
CO2 emissions by four percent a year...
Well, are we doing that?
I was two years and ten months old when I saw Star Wars. It is my earliest memory. My
dad didn 't believe that I actually remembered that until I started actually relating details
from the day it happened. He said after that all I could talk about was space.
I spent 10 years working at NASA. In the beginning of my time there in 2000, this is the kind
of community I was thinking of. It had all of the same needs as a community on earth
would have, but it had some very unique constraints. There 's no coal on the moon, there' s no petroleum,
there 's no natural gas, there' s no wind, there 's no atmosphere. The moon orbits the earth once
a month. For two weeks, the sun goes down and your solar panels don 't make any energy.
If you want to try to store enough energy in batteries for two weeks, it just simply
isn 't practical.
I thought nuclear power was dumb. I had no interest in it. I was like "Ah, old junk,
who would want to be into that? "It wasn 't until I realized that these efficiencies were
possible that I began getting really interested.
I 'm in this buddy of mine' s office. He 's got this book on his shelf and the book was called
"Fluid Fuel Reactors". He used to work at Oak Ridge National Labs in Tennessee and he
said "Yeah, way back when, they were doing some stuff on this at Oak Ridge," he goes
"I just went to the library and I got this old book." It was written in 1958 and he said
"I 've been meaning to look through it. I knew a little bit about it but not very much."
So I took the book home, a big old thick book, it was about 1, 000 pages, struggling really
hard to try to grasp the nuclear concepts in the book but it was intriguing enough to
me and it seemed really different than the kind of nuclear energy that we have now. They
also mention in this book a lot about thorium. Thorium, thorium, thorium, thorium. I was
like "Dude, what the heck is thorium?"
But I was intrigued enough that I began researching as much as I could. I was reading online,
I was reading blogs especially Rod Adams.
Taxpayers in the United States sent me to sea on submarines. I 've lived in an environment
that was 100 percent nuclear powered. It 's something that people just don' t hear about.
Nobody in the world knew that a self - sustained fission chain reaction was even possible up
until somewhere around 1938. Very few people understand all these options that are available
in nuclear energy.
Now with liquid fluoride thorium reactors, no high - level waste material is generated
and it can also reduced stockpiles of existing waste. So given that, is there more the government
can do to test the technology?
The reality is that we have waste, so it 's not going to improve the nuclear waste.
Please forgive my ignorance, but what is thorium?
If only my O - level science teacher could see me now. It is named after the Norse god Thor
and I know the noble baroness will be pleased to know that it 's dimorphic and there are
all sorts of other facts that she can find in Wikipedia, as indeed, I did.
My lords, my lords... my lords.
The Department of Energy cited my website as the single technical source for the molten
salt reactor in their Generation IV when they first published it. People say "Well that 's
quite an honor, "no it 's actually very pathetic because I' m Joe sitting in my garage doing
a website and this is the single technical source you came up with?
Does the administration understand all the options available? No. Does anybody really
understand clearly the fact that nuclear energy is a completely disruptive technology?
The liquid fluoride thorium reactor, I saw some of you kind of smile when it brings up
and that does concern me a little bit. What are you hearing about LFTR that 's not... what
are you hearing about the molten salt reactors that 's not there?
I would really be surprised if our leadership knows about this. I don 't think they read
blogs. The fact that we have an Internet today is going to ultimately make the difference.
You know we had Bronze Age and we had Iron Age and we had the Industrial Revolution.
I really think hundreds of years from now, they 'll say there was a Thorium Age that began.
Let me tell you how this stuff was discovered. There was a guy named Glenn Seaborg who worked
at Berkeley Labs in California in 1942. This was the guy who discovered plutonium. Coming
off discovering plutonium he thought, "I wonder if we can hit thorium with a neutron and turn
it into something. "You got to remember, fission had been discovered three years earlier, so
they were still in the very beginnings.
So he got this grad student. You know, everybody who 's been a grad student knows what it' s
like when a professor says, "All right. I want you to go into the nuclear lab and turn
on the neutron bombardment system and expose this sample of radioactive material and find
out what happens. "
"It 's a war right now, isn' t it, sir, right? I could be on the front lines."
"Yes, you could."
"OK. Yes sir. Absolutely. Off I go."
So the grad student went off, and he did the experiment. And he came back to Seaborg, and
he said, "Yep, I 've done it, sir. I have made something new. Thorium did absorb the neutron.
It became uranium - 233. Isn 't that cool? "
Seaborg said, "Yes, absolutely. OK! Now, let 's take the next step, poor little grad student!
I want you to go back. Now I want you to hit it with a neutron and see if it will fission.
Because I think it 'll fission. I think it' ll fission just like uranium - 235. "
"OK. Yes sir."
Goes off, does the experiment, comes back and says, "Yep, you were right. It did fission.
You 're correct. It is a new form of nuclear fuel. "
Then Seaborg popped the really, really important question. He said, "Now I want you to go figure
out how many neutrons came off when it fissioned. Because if that number is below 2, we really
don 't have a story here. If this number... you come back, and say it' s like 1. 5, then...
interesting fact goes in the back of the book. But if that number 's above 2, then that is
a big deal. "
Goes back, comes back. "Sir, the number is 2. 5."
Seaborg looks at his grad student. This is December 1942, and he said, "You 've just made
a $50 quadrillion discovery. "
Grad student was like "Uhh!"
Seaborg was absolutely right. He had figured out that thorium could serve as an essentially
unlimited nuclear fuel. And he knew how abundant thorium was in the crust of the Earth. And
he realized that through this process, if you had some uranium - 233, you could catalyze
the burning of thorium indefinitely.
You 're fissioning uranium - 233, but you' re making a new one. So it 's not really a catalyst
in the true chemical sense that a catalyst is not consumed in a reaction. But you can
almost think about it as a pseudo - catalyst.
So we 'll take it from first principles. Let' s talk a bit about what nuclear fission is.
You have fissile nuclei. That means this is a nucleus. If you hit it with a neutron, it 's
going to fission and split into two pieces, two fission products. And also significantly,
this one neutron is going to spawn the formation of two or three additional neutrons.
Why do we care? Here 's why we care...
Because every kilogram of fissile material will produce as much energy as 13, 000 barrels
of oil. Nuclear fission is a million times more energy - dense than a chemical reaction.
Civilization has changed over advancements in technology a whole lot more modest than
this.
When you fission something, it breaks into these two pieces, but they 're radioactive.
Why are they radioactive?
And this is a chart that shows the number of protons in matter and the number of neutrons.
Now, if the number of protons and the number of neutrons were the same, all of these isotopes
would stay on this nice line right here, you see?
But they don 't do that. At the beginning, it' s a roughly equal number of protons and
neutrons. But as they get heavier, they definitely get on the very neutron - rich side of things.
You see these black dots? Those are the stable nuclides and all the other guys are radioactive.
The strong nuclear forces holding the nucleus together, the protons are pushing the nucleus
apart. OK, the protons are all positively charged they want rip the thing apart. The
neutrons are adding more of that strong nuclear force glue, holding everything together and
they are not adding more of the push - it - apart stuff.
Way down here are uranium and thorium and they have about one and half times as many
neutrons as protons. When you burst them in half the two pieces that you get inherit that
ratio but it 's the wrong ratio for them. They are over here they wanted to be more like
one and a quarter instead of one and a half.
They have too many neutrons. Nature has a nifty process for fixing this little problem
it 's called beta decay. A neutron essentially turns into a proton and it spits out an electron.
When you fission a nucleus why is what you get out radioactive? And it has to do with
this proton and neutron balance. The balance is wrong for what you have made even though
it was right for what you started with.
These are the mass numbers of each of those and they assume two broad peaks of distribution.
This is the smaller fission product and this is the larger fission product because each
fission generates two of them. But, because they are neutron rich they have to beta decay
a couple of times before they reach a stable nucleus.
Let 's talk just a minute about radioactivity because I had an erroneous notion of what
radioactivity was. I thought that if you had something that have like a half - life of a
day, and you had something that had a half - life of a million years, it meant that the dude
that was radioactive for a day is like brrrrrr for a day and then, "Opp! I 'm done." And the
dude with half - life for a million years is like brrrrrrrrr for a million years and done.
OK.
So you go which one of these is more dangerous? Well, definitely the one that 's got a half - life
of a million years because that 's got to be like radioactive forever and the dude' s radioactive
for a day that 's not a big deal, right?
Completely wrong. OK. Utterly backwards. The dude who is radioactive for a day is really,
really radioactive. The dude that’s radioactive for a million years is hardly radioactive
at all. Which one of those two is more dangerous? The one that 's radioactive for a day by a
long shot.
So your radioactivity is directly and inversely proportional to your half - life. So all these
guys that have real short half - lives, very, very dangerous, but they are going away real
quick. This guy, 2. 3 million years, no problem. It 's not going to hurt you. It' s just not
nearly radioactive enough.
Now What about thorium and uranium? Both are naturally occurring materials. Thorium has
only one isotope thorium - 232. It has a 14 billion year half - life. So when the Universe
is twice as old as it is now, thorium will have only decayed one half - life.
What does it tell you how radioactive thorium is?
Hardly at all. That 's why it is still around. Uranium, two isotopes uranium - 235, uranium - 238
both of course are radioactive. U - 238 has a 5 billion year half - life, that 's pretty
old, that 's how old the earth is, that' s how old the Universe is.
Uranium - 235 on the other hand has a much shorter half - life, seven hundred million years. OK.
How common is this stuff on the earth? Most of the earth is made of oxygen. Isn 't that
strange? Like 46 percent of the crust of the earth is oxygen. Because everything is oxidized,
all the rocks, then silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, a bunch of stuff.
Well here is thorium at 10 parts per million, but there is other stuff that we think of
that is even less common; beryllium, tin, tungsten. Here 's uranium, two and a half parts
per million. Tungsten, aluminum, mercury, silver, and no surprise where is gold? That 's
why girls want you to give it to them.
Now, let 's say we were looking at uranium - 235 as if it was its own thing. It' s less than
one percent of uranium, it 's about 0. 7 percent uranium. You can see that uranium - 235 is on
par with the abundance of silver and platinum.
Can you imagine burning platinum for energy? That would just be nuts. It is nuts. And that 's
literally what we 're doing with our nuclear energy sources today. We' re burning this extremely
rare stuff and we 're not burning the common stuff, the uranium - 238 and the thorium. We' re
leaving that stuff unburnt.
Some people who are kind of environmentalists, they say, "Listen, nuclear power is not sustainable."
They say to me, "We 're going to run out of uranium." I said, "OK. I will yield that point
to you if we 're talking about today' s nuclear technology. On the other hand, if we start
thinking about some of these other things we can do, that story changes. "
Thorium all by itself is not going to release nuclear energy. But if you hit the thorium
with a neutron, the thorium will absorb the neutron and it will turn from thorium - 232
into thorium - 233. Thorium - 233 only has a half - life of like 20 minutes, so is it really radioactive?
Oh yeah, smoking radioactive, really, really hot stuff. It 's going to decay into protactinium - 233,
which has a half - life of about a month.
So, pretty darn hot stuff. You probably don 't want to mess with this stuff either. Then
it will decay over about a month to uranium - 233, which has a half life of about 160, 000 years,
and is much less radioactive.
Uranium - 233, if you hit it with a neutron it will fission. In addition to releasing
all that energy, it will release two or three additional neutrons. You need one of those
neutrons to go find another thorium and you need another one of those neutrons to find
another uranium - 233 to continue the reaction.
Some of these fission products have a really big propensity to eat neutrons. The way they
describe this in nuclear reactions is they call it a cross section. How probable is a
reaction going to be? One of those fission products is named xenon - 135, and here is its
cross section relative to two nuclear fuels. See these little bitty guys? Imagine we 're
playing darts or something, and throwing them. Which one are we going to hit?
When xenon - 135 forms from fission, look at all these chain, blah, blah, blah. Where 's
135? OK, that 's not particularly an uncommon event to form that particular guy. Xenon - 135
has a half life of nine hours. It 's very radioactive, but during that nine hours, it really wants
to eat your neutron.
This turns out to be a big problem for real nuclear reactors. It messes up how they want
to operate because of the existence of xenon. This actually was a contributing effect to
the Chernobyl disaster was the presence of xenon - 135. And it 's really hard to deal with
in solid fuel reactors. Xenon was such a big deal, in fact, this was one of the first reactors
that was ever built. This was the Hanford reactor in Washington. They built this during
the Manhattan project to make plutonium for nuclear weapons.
When they first built it, they turned it on and everything seemed to be going. After about
a day or two of running it, all of a sudden the power went and dropped, almost to zero.
They were like, "What the heck is that?", and they couldn 't figure it out. They left
it alone, and after about 12 or 18 hours it went and it came back up to power again, and
it held there. They 're like, "What?", and pretty soon it goes and drops off again. They' re
going, "This makes no sense, we 're not doing anything! The thing' s turning on and turning
off, and it 's turning on and it' s turning off. "
What was going on was, the reactor would turn on, and xenon - 135 would begin to build up.
And as it built up, it would start eating all these neurons, right. And they were and
it would take the reactor back down again.
Then after a while it would decay away, and once it decayed away [makes ascending plane
sound] the reactor would come back on again. So it was following this up and down effect.
Just crazy, I mean, these guys didn 't even know what xenon - 135 was, because this was
one of the first nuclear reactors ever built. Luckily for us, the guy who built this reactor
was this guy, Eugene Wigner.
He was unbelievably brilliant, maybe one of the smartest guys who ever lived. Won the
Nobel Prize. He would just lie in bed, trying to figure out “How far ahead of the Germans
are we? Where do you think they are? ” He was just always gaming it and trying to figure
it out.
He had thought, "What could possibly go wrong in this machine I built." He goes, "Well,
there could be something that we 'll make that will be very, very absorptive of neutrons.
And that something we make might decay quickly. And if it was really absorptive and it decayed
quickly, the reactor would do... this! "
He didn 't know what it was yet! He just was hypothesizing that such a thing existed! And
so when this machine of his started doing this, he goes, "I think I know what 's going
on. "There were a bunch of places to put in extra fuel, and he was able to override this
effect. I mean, we 're really lucky he did this, or we would not have been able to finish
the Manhattan Project. So they were able to complete the creation of plutonium in order
to make the first nuclear weapon.
They took natural uranium, and they separated those two isotopes, highly enriched it in
uranium - 235. They 'd take uranium - 235 from less than one percent up to like 90 - plus percent.
And this was really hard. It took big factories, very difficult to do isotopic enrichment.
But this is how they made the uranium for the first nuclear weapon used in war. This
was the bomb at Hiroshima. It was called "Little Boy," and they never tested it, because they
already knew it was going to work.
Then they said, "Well, what can we do with all this junk uranium - 238, the 99. 3 percent
of it? "Well, Seaborg had already figured out you could expose it to neutrons, and you
could make it into Plutonium.
After a short cooling - off period, the now highly irradiated fuel rods were transported
to T - plant in Hanford 's 200 area.
Now, plutonium is a different chemical element than uranium, so they can be chemically separated.
The process yielded minute amounts of plutonium. By weight, the most expensive material on
the planet.
And chemically separating things is like a bazillion times easier than isotopically separating
it. Because uranium - 235 and uranium - 238 are identical chemically. There 's no chemical
difference between them. But there is a chemical difference between plutonium and uranium,
so it was a lot easier to do a chemical separation of the plutonium you 'd made.
And that 's how they made the first nuclear weapon, the Trinity blast in New Mexico, and
that 's also how they made the Nagasaki bomb, Fat Man. Seaborg says, "OK, well, maybe we
can do the same thing with Thorium. Maybe we can expose it to neutrons, and we can make
it into uranium - 233. Uranium will be chemically separable from Thorium, and we can go make
a bomb out of it. "Right? Sounds great.
So they started looking at it, and it turns out, no, it 's a really bad idea, because as
you made the uranium - 233, you were always making uranium - 232. Here 's the decay chain
that uranium - 232 is on. It jumps down one year, three days, 55 seconds, 0. 16 seconds,
and it jumps down to these guys - bismuth - 212, thallium - 208 and these two decay products
have harder gamma emission.
They put out very, very strong gamma rays. And these gamma rays are super bad news if
you want to go and build a practical nuclear device. Because, number one they kill you
when you work on them, number two, they tell everybody who 's got gamma ray detectors where
the stuff is.
So really quickly they were going, OK, we can work with uranium - 235, that seems OK,
we can work with plutonium, that seems OK, but this uranium - 233 stuff has bad news for
making a nuclear weapon.
Thorium was set aside as a potential nuclear weapons fuel all during the war. After the
war, they picked up on this again because now they were thinking, "Let 's talk about
making power instead of making nuclear weapons. "This is a chart that shows absorption propensity
of each of these different nuclear fuels as a function of neutron energy.
This is what 's called thermal energy, this means they' ve been slowed way down. This is
fast energy, that means a neutron is still going really fast. Look how much bigger the
cross sections are in thermal than they are in fast.
What 's this guy down here, this is fast times 25. Taking this row, because you can barely
see these little bitty dots, and I 've blown it up by a factor 25. You can see some proportions
here. Now what these colors mean is the red means that it 's going to absorb the neutron
and the blue means that it 's going to absorb the neutron and fission.
What you want, you want blue. Thick blue is good. Well, lots of blue, because when you
hit these dudes with neutron, you want them fission.
Look at plutonium, wow, big target, right? But one third of the time it 's just going
to eat the neutron in thermal fission. That 's not good. On the other hand, in fast fission,
look at that, wow, was going to fission almost all the time. We like that was, but look how
many these little dots we are going to need to add up to this size. We are going to need
a lot.
How much energy did the neutron have that you smack the nuclear fuel with? How energy
did they have and then how many neutrons did you kick out when you smack it to fission?
These little bitty dots, they appear in this part of the curve. This is the fast region,
this is the thermal region. On the thermal region, look who is doing the best, look at
uranium - 233, about 2. 3. Look at plutonium, is that deep low two right there. That 's what
makes it that you cannot burn up uranium - 238 in a thermal - spectrum reactor like a water
cooled reactor like a CANDU or like a water reactor.
You just can 't do it. So they look at that and say, man, we just can' t burn uraniun - 238
in the thermal reactor. It just can 't be done. These guys aren' t deterred, they said, "Well,
here is what we 'll do, we' ll just build a fast reactor, because look how good it gets
in the fast region, wow, it gets above two, three, wow! This is really good! "This was
the genesis of the idea of the fast breeder reactor, a reactor that was based around having
fast neutrons and plutonium fuel.
But uranium - 233 on the other hand, OK, it gets a little better in the fast, but dang
it 's still pretty damn good right in the thermal.
Big targets, a lot easier, everybody who is pushing thorium said, "We like thermal. This
is the kind of reactor we want to build "and everybody who is pushing plutonium said," No,
no, no, we want a fast reactor, that 's the only way to do it. "
What did we really do, we didn 't do either one of these. In reality, all our reactors
today are burning uranium - 235 which is like burning platinum, very, very, very rare. We
didn 't take either one of these paths ultimately. This was the great division in the beginning,
was it going to thorium or is it going to be plutonium.
Wigner was not successful in convincing the bulk of the nuclear community to take the
thorium approach. They by and large said, "We 're going to go the plutonium route." One
of the reasons why was they had developed a great deal of understanding about plutonium
from the weapons program. They had made the stuff. They had worked with its chemistry.
They 'd made fuel out of it. They go, "We get this. Thorium? We haven' t really messed with
thorium. It would be like starting over. "
That propensity there was to go and do what you already knew how to do. The plutonium
was so much better developed than the thorium. So, Wigner was not terribly successful in
making converts in the nuclear community. He did make one convert - Alvin Weinberg.
He was his student during the Manhattan Project.
Weinberg got it. He got the big picture. "We need thorium. We need thorium reactor. We
need liquid fuel. I see it. I see what we 've got to do. "Weinberg got a job offer to be
the director of Oak Ridge National Labs in 1955. He was 35 years old. He was a year younger
than I am. I 'm sitting there going, "Dude, when Weinberg was my age he was running Oak
Ridge National Lab. What am I doing? I 'm in a basement somewhere. "
[laughter]
I 'm just teasing.
[laughter]
It 's not my mom' s basement so I feel better.
So he goes to Oak Ridge and Wigner said, "Alvin, you 've got to go there because you' ve got
to go see if you can make this thorium work. It 's that important. "Alvin got it.
Here was a quote from his book. He said, "Until then I had never quite appreciated the full
significance of the breeder. "When he 's talking about breeder he actually means the thorium
reactor. "But now I became obsessed with the idea that humanity 's whole future depended
on the breeder. "The idea that if you don 't go and access the energies of thorium, we' re
not going to make it. We can 't make it on the uranium - 235.
One of the first things that happened when he got to Oak Ridge, the Atomic Energy Commission
called him up and said, "You 're done in the reactor business. We' re giving all the reactor
work to Argon National Labs in Chicago and you guys aren 't part of the deal anymore. "
Argon National Labs was fully going for the plutonium fast breeder. That was there whole
thing was to do the plutonium fast breeder.
Right off the bat, Weinberg was like, "Oh my gosh! What are we going to do?" About that
time, the Air Force said, "The navy has built their nuclear submarines and the Army has
come along and they have taken the same technology as the Navy, the water cooled reactor. They 're
doing their thing, but the Air Force wants to build a nuclear powered bomber. "Does that
just sound crazy?
[laughter]
It was just absolutely nuts.
Weinberg was a practical man and he said, "Hah, nuclear powered bomber? That is probably
a really dumb idea. "
But the military has a lot of money, "It wasn 't that I' d suddenly become converted to a belief
in nuclear airplanes. It was rather this was the only avenue open for ORNL for continuing
in reactor development. That the purpose was unattainable if not foolish was not so important. "
[laughter]
"A high temperature reactor could be useful for other purposes even if it never propelled
an airplane. "He knew that to make the nuclear airplane work, they couldn 't use water cooled
reactors. They couldn 't use high pressure reactors. They couldn' t use complicated solid
fuel reactors. They had to have something that was so slick, that was so safe, that
was so simple, that operated at low pressure - high temperature, and had all the features you
wanted in it. They didn 't even know what it was.
If this nuclear airplane program had not been established, the molten salt reactor would
have never been invented, because it is simply too radical, too different, too completely
out of the ball field of everything else for it to be arrived at through an evolutionary
development. It had to be forced into existence by requirements that were so difficult to
achieve, and then nuclear airplane was that.
So they began working on this high temperature reactor, and here was their notion. This reactor
was going to produce this high temperature heat. It was going to be ducted into a turbo
jet engine. The air was going to be sucked in, compressed. Then instead of a burner here
that would be injecting fuel, like a combustion system, you would have this heat exchanger
with a reactor. It would make the air hot, then the air would exhaust through the turbine
and make thrust.
So it 's the same idea as a jet engine, it' s just the heat source was the reactor rather
than the combustion of fuel. Remember this was invented before we had ICBMs or anything
like that. This was a doomsday weapon. If you 're flying this thing to Russia, it' s the
end of the world. So they didn 't even know what kind of reactor this would be, and they
began working and came up with the molten salt concept.
They didn 't know if it would work, so this built this proof of principle reactor, called
the Aircraft Reactor Experiment. They circulated the liquid fluoride salt in these tubes to
produce two and a half megawatts of thermal power.
Xenon is a gas. What happens to gases in a liquid. The gaseous fission product xenon
just came right out of the salt.
Can you imagine if what happened to poor Wigner in his Washington reactor happened to the
dude flying to Russia? He 'd be like, "This is your captain speaking. We' re going to have
to make an emergency landing over Siberia. Xenon level 's just getting a little too high
in the reactor back there, so we 're just going to set down on the tundra here for nine hours
while that old xenon 's going to come on down. We' ll be lighting up and taking off shortly. "
You know, I mean that 's not going to work.
And it ran for about 11 days in 1954.
It reached the highest temperatures that had ever been achieved by a nuclear reactor up
to that point.
And proved to them that, essentially, their notion was correct - that you could sustain
nuclear fission reactions inside a salt, that it would operate at high temperature and low
pressure, that it was very stable. And the reason why it was so stable was, as the salt
would heat up, there would be less fissile material in the nuclear reactor core, and
so fission became less likely.
Conversely, as the salt cooled down, there was more material, because the salt was contracting,
and fission became more likely.
The engineers out there, that 's a dynamically stable system.
It gets hotter, cools down, gets too cool, heats up.
Well, by this time it was about 1960. ICBMs were going great. We 'd perfected air to air
refueling. The Air Force was going, "Oh, man, you know, I don 't think we really need that
nuclear bomber anymore. "
Weinberg petitioned the Atomic Energy Commission in the United States for money and he got
a little bit. He got enough to build a demonstration reactor that was supposed to be less than
10 megawatts. They built it, and it was called the Molten Salt Reactors Experiment. It ran
from 1965 to 1969.
It turned out that thorium was a great fit in this reactor.
This is what 's called a two fluid, molten salt reactor design.
What is molten salt reactor in relation to LFTR and vice versa?
LFTR is a molten salt reactor. All LFTRs are molten salt reactors but not all molten salt
reactors are LFTRs.
You 've got this core fluid, a lithium beryllium salt, with uranium tetrafluoride in there.
Now what you want to do is you want to move that fuel you 've made from the blanket into
the core. And here 's how you do it. You take this stream of this blanket salt off and you
put it in this fluoride volatility column.
You hit the salt with fluorine gas, and what 'll happen is... Uranium has two kinds of fluorine
states it 'll be in. There' s uranium tetrafluoride, four fluoride ions, and there 's uranium hexafluoride,
six fluoride ions.
Uranium hexafluoride is a gas.
Uranium tetrafluoride is in solution.
If you hit it with fluorine it will start to bubble out of the salt, just like bubbles
in your pop. And that 's great because this is a neat trick. This is a way to get your
uranium product to come out of the blanket and leave everything behind.
This wouldn 't work if thorium also had this same trick. If thorium would turn into a hexafluoride
in a gas, we 'd be up the creek. But this is one of these little miracles of nature.
So you can sit there and pound thorium with fluoride all you want. It 's not going to change.
It 's going to stay in solution. But the uranium will come out as uranium hexafluoride, a gas.
Well now you need to move it into the core salts. So you bring a stream of core salt
over here and you introduce this uranium hexafluoride here. And now you hit it with a little hydrogen
gas.
The hydrogen will say to UF6, "Hey man, I want those two fluorines a whole lot worse
than you do. "Ahh! UF6 gets stuck up at the gas station, has to give up two fluorines
you know and drops from UF6 back to UF4. Whoop! It 's in solution now.
So now, you 've just refueled your core salt with uranium tetrafluoride. Cool trick, huh?
You 're continuously refueling your reactor, all the time. You' re always refueling the
core with new uranium - 233. And uranium - 233 is being consumed but the neutrons from the
fission are making new uranium - 233.
OK, well out of the top of this column comes hydrofluoric acid - HF. You send that down
to this electrolyzer unit. And you hit it with some electricity and the HF will split
into hydrogen gas and fluorine gas. And guess what - now you 've regenerated your two reactants.
So your fluorine and your hydrogen are ready for duty again to make this trick work.
This is a piece you can actually buy off the shelf. So this is pretty cool! This is a closed
cycle for how to get your new fuel from here into here. You 're essentially converting thorium
into energy. First into U233, and then into energy through fission. Now of course you 're
using up some thorium doing this. So you need to have a little feed of thorium fluoride,
you need to feed some new thorium into the blanket to make up for the thorium you are
consuming. But a very efficient reaction.
Let me introduce you to a typical nuclear reactor.
Watts Bar Plant in Tennessee, I 've actually been to this nuclear reactor before. This
has a distinction of being the newest nuclear reactor in the United States. This came online
in 1996. A big pressurized water reactor vessel. 150
atmospheres, solid nuclear fuel. Fission is going on. Water is being pumped through. It 's
getting hotter. This water then goes through a steam generator and in another loop of water
steam is being raised. It goes to the turbine, spins the turbine, which spins the generator
makes electricity.
This is the steam turbine. And when I was at Watts Bar this is the part I got to go
see.
There was not a skitch of dust on anything! Now, if any of you have been to a coal plant
and seen the same steam turbine, because they use the same technology at a coal plant. It
is nothing like this. A coal plant is dirty, it 's smelly, it' s filthy, and it 's dripping.
This thing was almost antiseptic in the way it look.
Is there a need for that?
I don 't know. So I' m standing next to this machine. You can 't really see a person, about
yay high here.
This is this low - pressure turbine. And this is turning the shaft that 's running this.
Now in front of this guy is this little thing called the high - pressure turbine. And you
can 't really see it. You see the big three low - pressure turbines but you don' t see the
high - pressure turbine. The high pressure turbine is little bitty. It 's like a third the size
of the generator. The high - pressure turbine is making about two - thirds of the torque that 's
turning the shaft.
And the low - pressure turbines are making about one - third of the torque that 's turning the
shaft. This little guy is doing almost all the work and these big, big, big guys are
hardly doing anything.
When the steam goes into the high - pressure turbine, it 's dense. It' s got a lot of energy
and a little volume. But then you let it blow down as it goes across the high pressure turbine
and becomes low - pressure steam.
That 's why these machines have to be so darn big. Because the steam that' s heating them
has already lost the vast majority of the energy that it 's going to give up.
This is the reactor itself, the reactor vessel up here is where all the control rods slide
in and out of the core. And then there 's these four steam generators, as big if not bigger
than the reactors and they also have to operate at these very high pressures.
There 's four of them. Look at that. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Big
pipes.
The number one accident people worry about with this kind of reactor is what 's called
the double - ended pipe break. One of these eight pipes, for whatever reason, shears.
And all of a sudden, pressure is lost in the reactor. That water that 's being held water
at 300 Celsius by 150 atmospheres of pressure, when you lose pressure it flashes to steam,
almost instantly to steam. And when that happens, its volume increases roughly by a factor of
1, 000. So what was yay dense is now not so dense anymore.
The other thing that happens is steam doesn 't take away heat nearly as well as liquid water
does from a surface. So all of a sudden your fuel rods are not being cooled nearly as effectively
as they were before. Now fission will stop because one of the things the water is doing
is slowing down the neutrons. So without the water the fission reaction stops. You don 't
have to put control rods in or anything. The reactor will turn off immediately. But it
will still be generating heat from those fission products.
Here 's what' ll happen if you have a double - ended pipe break. You get this entire containment
vessel filled with water.
Now, I don 't want to tell you all this because I' m trying to focus on negative situations
here. I 'm telling you this because this is what drives the design of this building. This
building is the size it is and it 's the way it is precisely to accommodate this event.
They 've designed this reactor so if this happens, all the steam is captured in this building
and doesn 't get out.
Look at the size of the reactor. Look at the size of the containment building. It 's huge.
It 's much bigger than the reactor and it' s all driven by that thousand to one difference
in the density between steam and liquid water. Now if this happens, you have to figure out
a way to get water back on the fuel rods to cool them. So they have a series of emergency
systems in this reactor and they operate at all different stages of pressure.
So the idea is if you 're still at high pressure and you' ve got to get water in there, we 've
got a system for that. If you 've lost some of your pressure and you' ve got to get water
in there, we 've got a system for that. If you' ve lost all your pressure and we 've got
to get water in there, we 've got a system for that. So there' s a lot of systems and
then there 's backups to those systems, and it' s all driven by this high pressure and
by the use of water.
Yes sir?
Does the control rod missile shield to keep the control rods from punching a hole through
the roof if the steam explosion reaches the reactor chamber?
Precisely. Here 's the control rod drive mechanism. Here' s the rods. If you breach this part,
let 's say the welding failed, and this thing goes "boom" and out shoot the control rods,
that 's there to keep them from doing bad things like punching a hole in the top.
That actually did happen one time. That was an army reactor and they did not have a containment
building. One poor guy got impaled to the ceiling by a control rod so...
That 's got to be the coolest way to die.
That was a real bad day. If he didn 't get impaled the radiation was going to get him.
The pinhole camera spotted several locations and sources of high gamma radiation activity
outside the reactor vessel presumably from reactor components blown from the core by
the force of the 500 PSI explosion.
The reactor vessel is about nine inch thick steel. When you 've got nine inch thick steel
and it has to be nuclear grade and it has to be perfect, you can 't go and weld nine
inch thick steel. They don 't make it that way. They forge it in one piece. Not a lot
of people have the capability to build a 10 - meter diameter, 20 - meter long, single piece, nine
inch thick forging. In fact, there 's exactly one place in the world you can build this.
It 's a place called Japan Steel Works in Japan.
It 's a limiting factor because you say "I want to build lots and lots of nuclear reactors."
Either you 're going to build a new heavy forging, which is really just for this task, or you' re
going to wait a long time to get your reactor in line to go do this.
Let me diss on water a few more times.
Here 's why water is not such a great thing for the inside of a nuclear reactor. Number
one, it can 't hack the temperature, we already talked about that. Number two, it' s a covalently
bonded substance. The oxygen has a covalent bond with two hydrogens. Neither one of those
bonds is strong enough to survive getting smacked around by a gamma or a neutron. They 're
just going too fast. Sure enough, they knock the hydrogens clean off.
Now, in a water cooled reactor, you have a system called a recombiner that will take
the hydrogen gas and the oxygen gas that is always being created from the nuclear reaction
and put them back together, because chemically they 'd much rather be water than being hydrogen
and oxygen. It 's a great system as long as it' s operating and the system is pumping.
Well, at Fukushima Daiichi, the problem was that the pumping power stopped. When the pumping
power stopped, water was still getting busted apart. Hydrogen is real light, and even though
it wants to get with oxygen again it will dissociate fairly quickly. The hydrogen will
sit at the top of the vessel and the oxygen will sit in a layer below it, and then there 's
the water.
The designers of that particular reactor had intentionally designed it so that you would
vent the hydrogen outside of the containment building. This has always been kind of controversial.
They ducted the hydrogen up to the upper decks of the reactor, which were outside the containment.
They 're just kind of a sparse steel frame structure up there. And one, two, three, we
say it happen on the news. First one filled with hydrogen, got to a certain point, boom.
The news said, "Oh, We had a nuclear explosion.", and I 'm like, "No, we didn' t. It wasn 't a
nuclear explosion. It was a hydrogen gas explosion. "It didn 't burst the containment.
I don 't want to diminish it too much but it was not nearly as scary as it sounded. It
happened one, two, three.
The tsunami hit about an hour after the reactors were shut down. Fission was long gone by the
time the tsunami came along. But the reactors were still managing decay heat. The tsunami
came and destroyed the diesel generators, but they still had batteries and those batteries
ran for about eight hours.
That eight hours was the most important time of all. If you had to pick eight hours to
make sure that the pumps were still working, those first eight hours were the most important
time. By the time the batteries ran dry and the pumps stopped, the reactor had gotten
past the worst part of its decay heat comedown. It was still going on, decay heat doesn 't
turn off, and it continues even in spent fuel. That decay heat continued to build. Heat was
not being removed from the reactor.
Why weren 't they using the power from the reactor to run the pumps? Because the reactor
had been turned off.
This shows if you do stupid designs, something bad will happen, even after 40 years. A friend
of mine was GE 's first nuclear safety engineer and he worked on the Fukushima plant, and
they would have meetings with the TEPCO officials and engineers and they would all nod their
heads in long meetings and say "We 'll do this, we' ll do that," and then they go off after
the meeting and do whatever they wanted. That 's why you had a 15 - foot sea wall with a 45 - foot
wave coming over, and diesel generators and fuel in the basement.
It has nothing to do with nuclear power, it has to do with bad management and you wouldn 't
even design a simple factory the way that was designed. I 'm sure you could talk to the
Japanese representative here about TEPCO 's management getting kicked out years ago for
fraud and other things. They 've had a history.
Let me talk about today 's nuclear fuel, because that is common to both boiling water reactors,
pressurized water reactors and CANDUs. This is a handful of these uranium oxide fuel pellets.
The guy 's got gloves on and it' s easy to think he 's got gloves on to protect him from the
uranium oxide, but now that I 've taught you about the true nature of radioactivity, you
might go "I 'm not so sure that stuff' s so dangerous after all," and you would be correct.
He is not protecting himself from the uranium, he 's protecting the uranium from himself.
That stuff has to stay super pure and super clean and you don 't want to get any of your
oils, or grease or sweat on nuclear fuel that 's going to go inside a fuel rod so that' s what
the gloves are for.
They take these fuel pellets and slide them down these zirconium tubes and they actually
will segregate the pellets along the length of the fuel assembly according to enrichment.
They 'll put the most enriched ones in the middle, and then they' ll kind of decrease
the enrichment along the length of the fuel assemblies. It 's really, really expensive
to fabricate solid fuel.
Back in the day, their business model for how to make a nuclear reactor was sometimes
referred to as a "razor blades business model," in other words sell these reactors to utilities
pretty much at cost in order to lock them in to a long - term supply contract.
It was good money for them, because once somebody 's bought your reactor, they' re going to buy
your Westinghouse 17x17 array fuel. They 're not going to go "Hey, GE, what kind of deal
can you give me on this? "And be told" Dude, you don 't have my reactor. "You' re working
with that guy, there 's no market out there once you build the reactor, you' re using his
fuel. If he decides to change the price on you, well, that 's tough.
Here 's the reactor. It' s got its lid off, and then they 'll fill the whole thing up to
a level with water, so they make the whole thing into a swimming pool. Fill this whole
thing up with water, because the water is radiation shielding. They take the fuel assemblies
out and put it in the spent fuel pool. This is what they have to do about every 18 months
to the reactor. They 'll take out about a third of the fuel and then they' ll load in about
a third new fresh fuel and then they 'll reshuffle the fuel that' s already been in there. They 'll
move it from the center out to the periphery.
It 's like "Lord of the Rings," "The Great Eye is looking," no, it' s really not in the
eye. Here is what it really is. It 's a cross - section of nuclear fuel. This is uranium oxide and
when you put it in a reactor for a while, one of the things xenon does, it 's a gas,
so it 's way, way, way less dense than solid fuel. When you make this gas, it starts to
break up the solid structure of the fuel.
The solid fuel will begin to swell and crack and the gasses, the krypton and the xenon
begin to fill up, and you begin to get this central void. This is actually a gap in the
fuel. Fission product gasses will accumulate here.
Wigner didn 't like solid fuel. He was a chemical engineer by training and he thought, "What
kind of industrial process do we run chemically based on solids? "He goes" We don 't. Everything
we do, we use as liquids or gasses because we can mix them completely. "You can take
a liquid, you can fully mix it. You can take a gas, you can fully mix it. You can 't take
a solid and fully mix it unless you turn it into a liquid or a gas.
To give you an idea, here 's what we do today. We make this solid uranium oxide fuel and
there 's a single pellet, and then we put them in these big reactor fuel elements, zirconium
tubes that are like 12 feet long and about this big around. We then stick them in the
reactor and irradiate them for a couple of years. We only burn up a small amount of the
uranium that 's in there, we take it out and we stick it in a spent fuel pool. It is not
very efficient.
The heavy water reactor will use about 0. 7 percent energy value and the light water...
Reactors in the United States, we 're extracting about half of 1 percent of the energy that' s
in the uranium. You can imagine going to your boss saying "I developed a new system", "Well
how efficient is it? "," It 's less than 1 percent "," Excuse me, what did you build? I think you
need to go work on that again, "you know. We just simply wouldn 't accept this.
I 'm an engineer. If you' re that far off 100 percent, man I want to get a whole lot closer
and Weinberg did too. They wanted to get to nearly 100 percent of the energy utilization.
The molten salt reactor experiment was the core part of it. They didn 't have a blanket
around it, they just wanted to see if they could get the first step to work, and they
were successful.
After they completed the molten salt reactor experiment, they went to the Atomic Energy
Commission they said "Hey, G, can we have some more money? We 'd like to go now and build
the real thing. We 'd like to build the blanket and hook a power conversion system on and
make electricity, "they felt like they 'd shot the moon. The Atomic Energy Commission unfortunately
did not share their zeal.
They had invested very heavily in an alternative technology, the plutonium fast breeder reactor
based on solid fuels and turning abundant uranium - 238 into plutonium - 239 and then burning
it in the reactor. It involved a whole different set of technologies that were much more in
line with the light water reactors. It 's funny, even at that time 50 years ago, nobody thought
the light water reactor, the heavy water reactor would be around very long. They were just
simply too inefficient in their use of nuclear fuel.
Like I was saying, the Atomic Energy Commission said "Hey, guess what, we 're putting all this
money in the fast breeder. We 've got all these companies lined up to do the fast breeder.
They even actually built one in Monroe, Michigan. It had had a meltdown. They were undeterred,
they were moving forward and so they told Weinberg to take a hike.
The story gets a little more complicated too because in addition to being a thorium guru,
Weinberg was also the original inventor of the pressurized water reactor. He had invented
it and gotten his patent for it in 1947, so it was a little bit of a tricky thing to have
the inventor of the light water reactor advocating for something very, very, very different.
And got a little worse than that too, because Weinberg was never really crazy about the
light water reactor. He didn 't like the fact that it had to run at really high pressure.
There would be an accident someday where you were not able to maintain the pressure or
keep cooling it. There could be a meltdown, there could be a release of radioactivity.
Does any of this sound familiar? And he was making enough of a stink about this that there
was a congressional leader named Chet Holifield...
A member of the joint Congressional Atomic Energy Committee...
Who told Alvin Weinberg, he said, "If you 're so concerned about the safety of nuclear energy,
it might be time for you to leave the nuclear business. "He wasn 't questioning the value
or the importance of nuclear energy, if anything he was far more convinced about that than
anyone else.
What he was questioning was whether the right path been taken in the development of nuclear
reactors. He was particularly well suited to make that question because his role as
inventor of predominant technology so he was quietly shown the door.
After he had left Oak Ridge you can imagine things did not go well for the research team
the Atomic Energy Commission, commissioned a report WASH 1222 I like to call it white
wash 1222.
Because they really nitpicked on three very, very small issues about the reactor and said
look big problems here. I don 't think we can go forward until these are resolved. When
it came time to talk about the safety and the performance of the reactor there may be
some safety advantages that haven 't been quantified yet regarding this approach but you know we
just really can 't be sure about that.
Just burns me up because I think big, big, big mistake United States made in walking
away from this.
So they put all their chips fast breeder reactor and that didn 't work out too well for them.
They start building one in Tennessee. The program ended up in getting canceled by Carter
in 1979 and was briefly resurrected by Reagan in 1981 and then cancelled again. So that 's
what happened to fast breed reactor in the United States, a couple of countries kept
going with it.
The French went with it in eighties they built Phénix and Superphénix and then they ended
up shutting down there fast breeder too and the Japanese tried it but they had several
but one called Monju and it had been shut down since the mid 90s.
Then a few months ago they turned it back on and then somebody dropped a crane in liquid
sodium and then they shut it off again, so you know everybody has tried the fast breeder
reactor. I think the Russian 's are trying it.
I have some good friends in nuclear industry. They are very big advocates of the fast breeder
reactor. The common name for now is the integral fast reactor. I am not the biggest fan a reactor
that is full of liquid sodium. If any of you are chemists in here you probably recall sodium
has a great infinity for just about everything.
What are your thoughts on the traveling wave reactor?
The traveling wave reactor is another form of a liquid metal fast breeder reactor. It
is a particularly difficult implementation of that reactor. That reactor is already hard
to build in first place, with the traveling wave they make it even more complicated by
saying we are going to leave the fuel in the reactor for the lifetime of the reactor.
Physically propagate this deflagration wave, a nuclear conversion and burning wave. Why
on Earth would you take such a hard reactor and make it even harder to what end? What
is your goal? And all I 've been able to read as far as their goal is that they want to
never have to recycle or replace the fuel.
At the end of their life their concept is to just bury the thing in the ground and leave
it there. I 'm thinking, "You don' t leave a bunch of plutonium in a pool of liquid sodium
underground for an extended period of time that is a bad disposal option. "
They have attracted Bill Gate who of course is an extremely wealthy man. If Bill Gates
wants to save a lot of money he can get in touch with me and I think I can talk him out
of traveling wave.
He won 't return my calls. Don' t feel bad.
I used to be so into fusion, specially helium - 3 fusion, mining in the mood. Oh my God! I 've
read so many books about that stuff.
Fusion is magical. If we make that happen it would be magical.
I took this fusion class when I was at Georgia Tech and I will never forget it. We started
studying and I go, "Man, this is really hard."
Charged particles don 't want to get near each other. Bare nuclei are both charged, positive
charged, they want to avoid each other.
And my professor had a really great way of putting it. "It 's like going to the mini golf."
He says, "You know how in mini golf you 've got the volcano, and the volcano' s got the
hole at the very top, and you 've got to putt your ball in a way that it goes all the way
up the side of the volcano, and 'phwep!' falls in the hole. "He goes," OK. That 's like fusion.
The ball is like a nucleus, and the volcano is the scattering effect.
So any time you want to have a nucleus go to another nucleus, it scatters; it rolls
up the mountain and it rolls down the side, it rolls over here, over there... and only
when you just perfectly get it on the right angle does it go in the volcano. "Now, the
problem with fusion, he goes, "You can 't steer the ball, you have to have enough temperature
so that it can make it all the way up the side of the volcano and fall in, and then
you have to have enough balls because you can 't steer them there at the mini golf park ",
that 's density, "and then because they' re flying all over the place, you 've got to make
sure that there 's a fence around the mini golf park so that they don' t get away. "That 's
confinement.
He said, "Those are your three things, density, temperature, and confinement, to make fusion
happen. "
I said, "Dude, that 's really hard!" So, I came up with another analogy, "So, I guess
fission would be like the mini golf park except now the volcano was flush, the hole was about
this big around, the balls are going slow, and every time the ball goes in the hole,
two more balls come out. "
He goes, "Yeah, that 's pretty good."
I 've looked at focus fusion, I' ve looked at steam - piston fusion, I 've looked at D - helium - 3
and P - boron, and all these other kind of things and I 'm still going, "I' m just not buying
it yet. "
You 're saying the business case isn' t there. That 's what you' re saying.
It 's just so darn hard! I mean, a fusion reactor is a big vacuum tube at 10 keV, which is like
15 patrillion degrees, and then inside this are superconducting magnets that are held
in liquid helium, and all of this is jacketed in a lithium blanket that will breed megacuries
of tritium, which will then be injected into this reactor which is driven by these giant
neutral - ion beams.
I mean, it 's like, "Oh my gosh! Can we make this thing any more complicated then it is?"
And even then you can 't hold the confinement for more than a few microseconds in the Tokamak
configuration, which is the most favored and desired.
Thorium 's actually a little bit more down to earth. If you go to the liquid form, force
yourself to make that technology commitment, 50 years from now, people will go, "Of course
that 's the answer! "
Fusion is so hard that we can build a fusion reactor, and we can have 100 PhDs working
on it. Fission is so easy that we can take a couple of kids out of high school, train
them for a few months, and they can be running a nuclear submarine.
Want to build a reactor to bring energy for the oil sands. This would be the perfect opportunity.
Well, if we have a reactor like this, do we need the oil sands?
I mean, that 's the way I look at it; I don' t know a lot about oil sands, but I know that
it 's a particularly hard way to get oil. People in the middle east can get oil a whole lot
cheaper from their place then people can get it from the oil sands. If I can beat them
by a million to one, maybe we ought to do that.
If you were to make the oil sands just a little tiny bit cleaner, then they would perk up
their ears, as opposed to clean energy in and of itself, because it relates to something
they know.
I sat on the plane next to a guy who was in the oil business, and he was telling me all
about the oil sands, and how much money they 're making and so forth. I was just sort of sitting
there, taking it in, listening...
Gas... How much does gas cost here?
A dollar... A dollar ten?
Gas costs a dollar ten?
Yeah, it 's expensive, because we have more tax on gasoline, which I think is a good idea.
What do you pay for gas?
I 'm paying like, $3. 50 for gas.
Really?
I thought gas was cheaper in America!
The Canadian dollar 's almost on par, isn' t it?
Yeah.
Oh wait... you all do it in liters!
Do we pump your car with gas and go, "I just pumped twelve gallons of gas into my car.
Do you know how much napalm that would make? If I dropped that on a village, I would kill
5, 000 little children! "You know, and you 're like," No! Of course not! I' m going to get
into my car and drive 300 miles on it! "I mean, it 's all about what you do; none of
this stuff is inherently good or bad, it 's what you decide to do with it.
You know, one of the things that doesn 't earn me a lot of friends is the notion when we
talk about, "Oh, so - and - so can 't enrich uranium," I go, "No offense, but who are we to tell
anybody what they can do? "I mean, uranium 's uranium, and it' s not exactly like we have
a monopoly on the stuff.
Same thing goes for things like plutonium. Plutonium is... I 'm not the biggest fan of
plutonium because I 'm not crazy about the plutonium fast - breeder reactor, but there' s
nothing good or bad about plutonium. Plutonium just is. It 's what you decide to do with it.
Now, we 've made a lot of plutonium in our reactors. What are we going to do with it?
Are we going to drop it in a hole in the ground, or are we going to feed it to a reactor like
LFTR and make power out of it? I think that 's a whole lot smarter thing to do.
The other day I was debating some anti - nukes, and they were getting on LFTR because they
said, "Oh, this is going to use uranium. You know, from nuclear weapons!" And I said, "I
think you guys would be all over that! Take nuclear weapons, take them apart, take the
uranium out, burn it up, make electricity! You want to leave it in the bomb? What do
you want to do with it? "
The Navy has as many reactors as we have in the civilian world. Think about the security
posture that the US would have if we didn 't have this nuclear capability. Submarines can
stay underwater and go under the polar ice cap. If you look the ground forces today,
we seem to be using a lot of energy, people wonder if we could cut that down. The energy
is used for good purposes.
So, the reason that we can fight in the night, take out enemies without losing our own soldiers
is because we have energy powered capabilities. We have sensors, radios, all sorts of things
that give us the advantage, and they 're all based on energy. The way that we' re sustaining
the force is we 're trucking liquids over the ground.
When I was waiting to go into Iraq since we began invasion in 2003 some of generals couldn 't
get spare parts or supplies out forward because the convoys were busy carrying fuel and water.
More significantly, cost in lives, half of our losses in Iraq are associated with the
supply chain.
If we didn 't have to carry all that liquid - 80 percent of the supply chain - we might
be able to find another way, something called an adaptive brigade. This force could provide
its own energy and water and not really have to be resupplied for say a month at a time.
If you need energy during the day, put about a hundred acres of solar panels.
If you have a threat out there, that might not work too well because you have to secure
the whole perimeter and so now all your soldiers spend their time patrolling the hundred acre
solar farm.
What if we had a reactor that was so safe and simple and economical that you could take
it out to the battlefield and use it, and then when you leave, leave it for the host
nation and they run it.
Prosperity is related to energy. If we can bring people to about 2, 000 kilowatt hours
per year of electrical energy, they have a chance of achieving prosperity. Now, of course,
prosperity depends upon the rule of law, good government, property rights, education, but
electric power for heat, light, transportation, safety and so on is a critical element of
prosperity today.
Developing countries know this. Energy in coal use is growing rapidly in all the developing
countries. They want to achieve that level of prosperity and they 're being supported
by Peabody Coal.
The National Academy of Sciences said that every freshwater fish in the United States
of America now has dangerous levels of mercury in its flesh. And that mercury is coming from
coal burning power plants.
My levels of mercury came back 10 times the amount of what the EPA considers safe. I was
told by Dr. David Carpenter, who is the national authority on mercury toxins, that a woman
with my levels of mercury in her blood would have children with cognitive impairment with
permanent brain damage.
I said, "Do you mean she might have?" And he said, "No, no, no. The science is very
clear right now. "Her children would have some level of permanent neurological impairment,
probably as a permanent IQ loss in those kids of five to seven points.
There are now 640, 000 children born in this country every year who 've been exposed to
dangerous levels of mercury in their mother 's wombs. Ozone and particulates from coal burning
power plants kill 60, 000 Americans a year. A million asthma attacks, a million lost workdays
every year.
That 's part of the cost of coal that they don' t tell you about when they say "Oh, it 's
only, you know, ten cents a kilowatt hour. "
Both light water reactors and CANDUs do not use very much of the energy in the fuel and
they leave behind two classes of materials. One is the actual fission products - that 's
what happens when you fission the stuff. Then there is what 's called the transuranics. That' s
what happens when the uranium absorbs the neutron and doesn 't fission, and turns into
plutonium, americium and curium and few other, most of it is plutonium.
The overwhelming majority of transuranics are plutonium. So when you talk to people
about waste disposal, they say, "What 's the concern?" Well, most of the stuff that' s in
the fuel is just uranium. It 's no more radioactive than it was when you stuck it in, and it' s
not really a concern.
And the fission products, they are very radioactive when they are created, but they decay rather
quickly. They don 't really have long - term radioactivity. They just decay too fast, it
is the deal. There are a few of them that have very long half - lives but that means their
radioactivity levels are extremely low and they just don 't really pose a hazard.
The real challenge with spent fuel management is the presence of those transuranics - plutonium,
americium, curium - because they have moderate half - lives and they have complicated decay
chains. When you 're looking at a Yucca mountain or a disposal site you say, "What are we going
to do with that? "
The basic advantage of LFTR over that approach is we don 't form those transuranics. We burn
up essentially all of the fuel in this process because we don 't remove fuel from the reactor
until it 's a fission product.
General idea is you don 't want uranium, thorium, or anything else to end up in your waste stream
and that 's a pretty straightforward proposition in this fluid - fueled reactor. So our waste
story is a lot different. You can also then turn around and go back and take some of the
waste that 's already been created in our uranium - fueled reactors and potentially destroy those long
lived transuranics through fission.
Waiting them out to decay is a very slow process. Plutonium 239, for instance, has a 24, 000
year half - life. That 's a long time you' re going to be waiting for that to decay. On
the other hand, you can fission it and then those fission products will decay very rapidly
and you also get an energy release and a neutron release, both of which are good.
A thousand kilograms of U - 233 is roughly what we 've got. Ninety percent of that' ll fission.
We can make about 500 to $600 million in electricity and another 50 or $60 million on the fission
of the uranium - 235. Almost all of it will ultimately end up fissioning. Out of about
a thousand kilograms, about 15 kilograms of plutonium - 238 will be left over. This is good
stuff. NASA is desperate for this stuff. Plutonium - 238 is different than plutonium - 239, the stuff
we use in bombs. In fact it 's worthless for bombs.
These radioisotope thermoelectric generators are based on plutonium - 238 and this is the
only way that we 've been able to explore the outer solar system. The United States is unique.
It 's the only country in the world that has sent space probes beyond the Asteroid Belt
and it 's all been based on having this technology. Short answer, we' re out of this stuff. It
's gone. We' ve used it all up. The Russians used to sell us some. They 've sold us all
their inventory. It 's gone.
NASA 's got billions of dollars of deep space missions hinging on having enough of this
stuff to run the batteries to let the thing call home. We will be able to make this in
LFTR. If you 've heard sometimes about us saying "We burn up 99 percent of the fuel and there' s
one percent left ", the one percent left is that stuff and it 's worth almost as much as
the stuff we burn up.
In addition, it would make medical molybdenum - 99.
We are about to shut down the one reactor in Canada that is making molybdenum - 99 for
medical purposes in 2015. There are hundreds of thousands of patients that will not be
able to get their molybdenum - 99 that they need for diagnostic procedures when that happens.
We can make molybdenum - 99 just in normal course of operation and we can remove it very easily.
There are four natural decay chains of alpha - emitting radioisotopes. One starts with U - 238, U - 235,
thorium - 232, and then there 's one that' s extinct because it has no long - lived precursors on
it. It was there in the supernova billions of years ago. It 's gone now. It' s on the U - 233
decay chain. There 's a special product on there, bismuth - 213, that could be a smart
bomb against cancer. They attach the bismuth - 213 to an antibody.
That bismuth only has a half - life of 45 minutes so it 's very radioactive and it' s going away
quickly. But in that time, that antibody can go and find a cancer cell. The bismuth decays
and alpha particle goes through the cell, and it kills the cancer. The radiation technique
we use in cancer therapy today, they 're all based on beta - emitting isotopes, not on alpha - emitting
isotopes. They have a big kill radius. They 're not very directable. It' s OK, but it 's really
not a smart bomb.
Alpha - admitting isotopes are really rare. It 's hard to get them. It' s hard to get the
right kind, the right chemical one that will lock onto the right thing that 's close enough
to being stable that even after it decays, it doesn 't just decay ten more times in the
body. Bismuth - 213 is one decay away from being done.
And it 's especially good against dispersed cancers, like leukemia, cancer of the blood.
Not tumorous cancers, where there 's a big hard lump that you can go in and cut out with
surgery, but stuff that 's hard to get to. Pancreatic cancer - you get pancreatic cancer,
you 're probably looking at a death sentence, that' s how bad it is.
Here 's the problem, bismuth - 213 is unique in this capability and bismuth - 213 can only
be generated from the decay of Uranium - 233.
I sometimes even lie in bed thinking, if my kid had leukemia, how hard would I be working
on getting this therapy ready for them to save lives and if it 's that important, why
aren 't I going full bore on it right now?
How much did it cost to build?
What 's your ballpark figure? Is this Home Depot stuff, or...
No. No, I think a first unit which is probably going to be on the order of 20 / 30 megawatts
electric is - we 're looking at several hundred million dollars to develop that, but then
taking a step beyond that to utility - class scale reactor, probably another several hundred
million dollars.
You 're probably looking at a billion dollars to bring it up to utility - class, but when
you consider what it 's going to do, that' s really not all that much money. A lot of it
is the engineering and then the regulation is a huge question mark.
It 's actually not a lot of money, in a sense.
I 've learned it' s not about the number, it 's about the uncertainty on the number. You can
go to an investment bank right now and you can say "I want to build and oil drilling
platform and it 's going to cost 12 billion dollars, "and they will write you a check
for that because you can go and say, "I 've built 50 of these platforms before, here' s
about where the price came out. It 's going to go in this area, which right now is producing
this much oil, it 's going to be out here. It' s going to take this long to recover this
much oil based on how we 've done it the other 50 times. "And they go, there' s not a lot
of uncertainty in doing this.
You start by not making a full LFTR...
Yes.
... but making like a little piece. Take some of these by - products and you use that money
to get this little first stage that starts making money...
Are you sure that we don 't have ethernet plugged into the back of your head somewhere?
We 're doing wireless here. I don' t think.
Could you repeat the question?
No.
No. I 'm sorry, this question' s not covered by an NDA.
We got some smart people in this room.
In aerospace engineering, we were taught to put development costs and unit costs in the
separate category. It 's like you build a fighter and you spend billions of dollars to design
it, but then you run off copies for 20 million dollars apiece. That 's how they build 737s
or other airplanes.
If you want to go, "What 's the unit cost going to be?", there' s reason to think this is going
to be a lot less expensive than what we have today if we set the development in another
column.
The reason why, number one, low pressure operation. That 's the biggest one. When you don' t have
to have 96 steel pressure vessels, huge concrete containments. Number two, you don 't have to
fabricate fuel. You don 't have to enrich it. You don' t have to fabricate it and you don 't
have to have the approach to disposal as we do today.
Those two features right away are a big deal. Number three is the safety systems. High pressure,
water cooler reactors have an abundance of safety systems designed to always keep the
core covered with water. So, if one system has 99 percent reliability; well, you need
another one that also has it so that you can get 99. 9 and maybe statisticians will get
mad at me, I might be doing it wrong.
One of the things that makes the conventional reactors so expensive the containment vessel
and you 've touched on that. The other is all the security apparatus around the maintaining
of the fissile material so that it doesn 't get diverted for military purposes.
I 've scratched my head about that with existing reactors because our reactors, at least in
the United States, don 't use highly registered uranium.
Well, that 's one of the fears and that' s one of the security reasons around it. Whether
it 's real or not -
Yeah, I guess I would have to challenge whether it 's real or not.
It wasn 't that many years ago that we were able to show parties of visitors around the
site and actually show them what good condition the site is in and how safe it is. It 's only
since 9 / 11 that we 've had to stop inviting visitors. We' ve always had a very open policy;
very keen to show people how good we are at what we do and how safe the plant is. It 's
very difficult to convince yourself that things are safe because you can 't see what' s going
on.
Even the plutonium inside the reactor is what 's called reactor - grade plutonium, which isn' t
suitable.
Try going to any facilitate in North America now, they have SWAT teams and -
I 've toured a nuclear power plant. We' ve really got the working when we went in there. I 'm
not exactlysure what the basis of that was, whether they were worried about theft of fissile
material - that would be pretty hard. I 'd have to go and depressurize the core, take
the lid off, get access to all the spent fuel, somehow remove it from the spent fuel pool
into some sort of transport cask, take it off the site to a reprocessing facility that
doesn 't exist and - I mean, I just go "There' s got to be another reason they have all that
security. "
Watch the TV news.
Well, you know. It just seems to me, when there 's a subject that I know a little bit
about and watch how the news covers it, I get frustrated really quickly.
I think just about every media outlet I 've seen is drumming up fear. From the New York
Times to the Huffington Post to the Fox News.
There 's been a recent spike in infant deaths in Philadelphia and there' s one expert right
now who is saying, "It 's radioactive levels in our water that' s to blame for that."
This has been a very bipartisan approach to scaring the public.
Radiation comes across the ocean. It is dissipated by wind current and salt spray, but it is
reaching the shore of California.
There 's radiation all over the place, every single day, but you' re talking the damaging
radiation. That 's the thing we' re most concerned about and even in Chernobyl, that didn 't get
to the United States in damaging amounts. How is it going to do that?
OK, you know what Bernie. From your mouth, to God 's ears.
Our media is not built around effectively and accurately disseminating information to
the public. Our media is built around...
Thank you. Our media is built around putting your eyeballs on their print or on their website
and keeping them there. The best way to keep them there is to scare you to death.
Only 24 hours after the most horrendous tragic, gargantuan natural disaster of an earthquake
followed by the tsunami, the only story in town was about Fukushima.
As an engineer, we are taught that our responsibility is to accurately and effectively communicate
and disseminate information both to other engineers and to the public at large.
So an engineer gets on TV and they say, "What 's going to happen, Dr. So - and - So?", and he goes,
"Well, there 's a possibility several things could happen. A very low probability event
is that this might happen, but it 's much more likely that - - "" Oh, wait. Let' s get back
to that low probability event. Now, in that low probability event, what could happen? "
"You know, I guess it 's possible that - but this is really unlikely, and the wind would
have to blow this way and - - "" Well, let 's go that way. "The poor engineer, he' s thinking
we 're up 10 ^ - 12 now, or something like that.
And they 're going, "Does Godzilla form?" "Well, you know, a double ended DNA break, I suppose
in the right gene, could actually trigger an increased growth rate of hormone, which
could actually lead to mild gigantism. "
They only wanted to know about the risks from the nuclear incident. And what they particularly
wanted to know, and asked many times was what is the worst case scenario.
Godzilla is coming tomorrow. It 's like "Oh man, we' re like 10 ^ - 32 at this point. The
proton is going to decay before this happens. "
You already have a terrible scare story. It wasn 't as if we were asking them to cover
the good news, not the bad news. There was plenty of bad news.
I had a friend of mine. She and her husband are diplomats in China and she wrote me as
breathlessly as you can in an email and she said, "Kirk, are we going to be OK? I 'm in
China, are we going to be all right? "I said," Don 't worry. The iodine - 131 would have to
blow all the way around the world and then come back around to get you in China and there
wouldn 't be enough of it, has an eight and a half day life, so it would have decayed
to nothing right about here. "Blah, blah, blah.
But, she was scared to death and this is a smart girl.
The Science Media Center 's job was to line up people who know about radiation, who know
about its affects on humans and without exception, they said from the beginning, "This is a very,
very serious incident, but in terms of it being a threat, even to people in Tokyo, never
mind to people in Glasgow, they were expressing, time after time, apart from the people in
the exclusion zone, that this threat was very, very, very, very small. "And indeed, they
still feel it is very small.
Nuclear experts have a vested interest in playing down nuclear incidents.
We have journalists coming to us and saying, "My editor has said to me, what are the apologists
saying today? "because we were running almost daily press briefings, with different experts.
None of them actually worked for industry as it happened, but yeah, there was this idea,
that they would say that, wouldn 't they? These leading scientists, who publish and peer - review
journals, who work for very respected scientific institutions, are playing down an incident
because they support the nuclear industry. That is quite a charge.
I was just reading an article this morning saying they detected radioactivity in milk
and I thought, of course they detected radioactivity in milk. All milk is radioactive.
Two of them said, Fiona, our editors think there is something uniquely terrifying about
radiation. There is something unique to that word that has the capacity to really terrify
people. What a strange set of news values that what justifies the amount of coverage
is what your editors feel terrifies people.
What they really meant to say was there was a particular radio - isotope they found in the
milk that came from the Japanese nuclear plant. The article, of course, didn 't mention that,
which would make people think, "Uh - oh, my milk has gone from zero radioactivity to some
radioactivity which must be bad and I must be in real trouble now. "
The way that this was covered was wrong. I feel confident in saying that because of how
many journalists felt uneasy about this. I know of journalists who were taken off this
story because what they were writing was too measured and that 's in a really significant,
major news room in this country.
In terms of the public 's perception of risk, things that might be true because I read them
on the Internet, Neil deGrasse Tyson tweeted today, "the causes of death worldwide in March
2011, starvation, three million. "
Neil deGrasse Tyson, big fan of his. We 've needed somebody like Neil deGrasse Tyson ever
since Carl Sagan died. But yeah, what 's the first one on his list, starvation?
Starvation, 3, 000, 000; malaria, 250, 000; car crashes, 100, 000; quakes and tsunamis 28, 000.
Body count on nuclear power death is what? Low.
Civilian nuclear power in the United States hasn 't killed anyone. The body count would
be zero.
So when Three Mile Island releases some radiation, you 'd want to incorporate statistic likelihood
of someone getting thyroid cancer in any number.
No, because even the statistical likelihood is theory that is not based on facts. It 's
called the linear no - threshold hypothesis and it 's not based on epidemiological data.
It 's based on the assumption that radiation will harm you at whatever degree - to whatever
degree you are exposed.
I thought that that was established actually. I thought that...
No, it 's established.
I 've heard that there' s...
It 's established policy. That' s where that no such thing as safe radiation - that comes
from the linear no - threshold hypothesis. It is established in regulation yet, there 's
no epidemiological data to back that up. There is no study that says we have taken a cohort
of people and we have exposed them to one percent more radiation than normally would
get and we 've seen one percent more cancer.
In fact, there are many places in the world where back room levels of radiation are substantially
higher if the linear no - threshold hypothesis was in fact true or even approaching truth,
you would see statistically significantly higher levels of cancer in those populations,
those cohorts. But what happens? Not only is there not higher levels of cancer, there
are actually suppressed levels of cancer.
Which leads to a theory that does have substantiation in the data and that 's called hormesis. Hormesis
is simply a little bit is good for you and radiation appears to be one of these things
where a little bit more is actually good for you and suppresses your development of cancer.
And I say, well why would a little bit of radiation be good for me? When you go and
exercise, you damage your muscles, but your body rebuilds them and rebuilds them stronger
than they were before. Radiation stimulates cellular damage, but it also stimulates the
body 's repair mechanism.
If hormesis became policy instead of linear no - threshold, we would have an incredibly
different approach to radiation. In fact, in some ways, we actually do accept hormesis
when it comes to natural radiation, but we don 't accept it when it comes to artificial
radiation. The reality is, there 's no difference between the two.
We have a three year environmental assessment process in Canada to build a nuclear reactor
and we have a weekend to produce a coal plant.
Coal and gas plants are able to release radioactive materials into the environments in much greater
amounts than a nuclear plant would ever possibly be allowed to because they are considered
what 's called NORM, Natural Occurring Radioactive Materials. For instance, when you go frack
a shale and you pull gas out, a lot of radon comes out with that too.
You burn the gas, that radon 's being released. Nobody counts that radon against the gas.
If they did, the regulatory commission would shut the gas plant down, same with coal. Coal
contains small amounts of uranium and thorium. They go up the stack, they 're dispersed.
That 's why they can' t tell you how much waste they produced.
Yeah, and they spend a lot of money to make sure that regulatory agencies do not regulate
NORM for a coal or gas plant the way they regulate radioactive emissions from a nuclear
plant. If they did, we would be shutting down all of our coal and gas plants based on radioactivity
alone.
Even if linear no - threshold was actually true - let 's say for a minute it was true, and
this was the reality of the world. You would still be much better off establishing an entire
world powered by nuclear power. The reason why is because of the radioactive releases
from coal. You would want to shut down coal so you could have nuclear, because coal releases
more radiation than nuclear by several orders of magnitude.
The notion that there is no safe amount of radiation is not a substantiated or even an
accurate statement. It is probably actually utterly inaccurate. But, it is commonly found
as a basis of public policy around the world.
That was my understanding until just now, that there was no safe level of radiation.
Two great books on this - "Terrestrial Energy" by Bill Tucker, and "The Power to Save the
World "by Gwen Cravens - go into this topic extensively. Until this notion of low exposure
levels of radiation is addressed and put to bed, it will forever dog the nuclear industry.
A sunburn is radiation damage. That 's radiation burn. We don' t call it that, but that 's what
it is. Your body is responding, trying to prevent further radiation damage, ionizing
radiation to your skin and your cells, and it 's generating melanin, which is a natural
shielding mechanism.
You don 't want to let anybody get too much radiation dose at any one time and the radioactivity
that we get from nuclear reactors is extremely small in comparison to the radioactivity we 're
getting from other sources. The biggest one being radon. There 's a radioactive gas that' s
coming out of the ground all the time. You 're breathing it right now. It is responsible
by far for the majority of the radioactivity that your body receives. It 's just the planet
we live on.
Inside the earth, thorium and uranium are decaying, and they 're decaying very slowly,
but there 's a lot of them and the earth is big. They produce most of the heat that drives
the internal processes of the earth. They produce the heat that drives plate tectonics,
and they produce the heat that drives the generation of the magnetic field. If we didn 't
have the energy from thorium, we wouldn 't have carbon recycling in the crust.
A bigger deal is the magnetic field, because the magnetic field is deflecting the solar
wind. If you don 't have a magnetic field deflecting the solar wind, over billions of years your
planet ends up like Mars. Because the solar wind will strip off a planet 's atmosphere
without the protecting nature of the magnetic field. So if we didn 't have the energy from
thorium inside the earth, we would be on a dead planet.
A fun thing I tell people, I say, "What 's green energy?" They go, "Geothermal is green
energy. "Do you know where geothermal comes from? No. It comes from decay of Thorium inside
the earth. Is geothermal renewable? Yes! OK, then Thorium is renewable. "No, it 's not,
you 're using it up! "Well, you' re using up Thorium as it decays inside the earth, too.
So any argument for geothermal, if it is rigorously pursued, is an argument for the renewability
of thorium as an energy resource. And I love to have that debate. They usually change the
rules on me as I get into it.
But a good one to play on your friends if they start giving you a hard time for coming
to protospace and talking about Thorium, you say, "Dude, it 's green energy." "What!?"
If you 're concerned with the environment, then you want to be aware of what the power
density of any source is. Anybody who 's trying to sell you biofuels, or this kind of thing,
what do you do about the thermodynamic inefficiency of combustion engines? Fuels, that you burn,
is down in here. Whenever we burn something, we 're using a very inefficient process. Thermodynamics
typically gives us about 30 percent of the energy when we burn fuel.
So every time you put a dollar 's worth of gas in your car, kiss 60 cents goodbye, because
it 's going to go out of the exhaust pipe as heat. And we waste 10 percent of what' s generated
in transmission lines. So whenever they talk about these remote solar farms, or remote
wind farms or anything, you have a debt of 10 percent that you 're paying from now on,
forever. You 're never going to get that energy back.
Five megawatt, top of the line Siemens wind mill, takes 10 acres. And five megawatts per
10 acres, that 's half a megawatt per acre. If you move up to fission, you got hundreds
of thousands more watts per square foot, per acre, per pound. Whatever. And if you move
up to fusion, you get another 10, 000 times that. Fusion we don 't have to wait for, because
fission is good enough for us, particularly with the thorium cycle.
A nuclear article would be written. Author of the article will go to me, or Rod Adams,
or John Wheeler - somebody who 's kind of known as a public advocate for nuclear. And then
to go find the other side, Ed Lyman, or Jim Riccio of Greenpeace, or one of these other
guys. Now contrast this with an article around solar, or wind, and I look for this all the
time. I 'm always trying to see, is there another side in those articles? There' s never another
side. "Such and such a company has announced they 're going to put 50 megawatts of windmills
in this site. World rejoices. "
And they 've chewed up half the mountain to put the windmills up there.
They get more subsidies per megawatt hour than any other form of energy by one or two
orders of magnitude. I mean, it is huge! We 're offering to buy back solar energy from people
who produce it at 35 to 50 cents a kilowatt hour. I mean, that 's obscene. Why on Earth,
if you 're making energy at your home, you should sell it back to the grid at whatever
the grid is buying at that time. The grid should not have to buy energy from you at
some massively increased price.
But they 're subsidizing technology until it gets more efficient.
When all of these tariffs are reduced, the things that we 're supposed to encourage, and
jump start an industry, the industry collapses. Solar industry in Germany and in Spain is
in utter collapse because of the projected removal of fees and tariffs because these
are simply not economical sources of energy. The subsidy may be well intentioned to try
to get the industry to get going on its own but that 's usually not the way things work.
Every energy source is subsidized, right? If oil is subsidized because we 're sending
people off to war...
The levels of the subsidies are substantially lower for established industries than they
are for things like solar and wind.
George Monbiot, who writes in The Guardian, he has recently come out very strongly in
support of nuclear power because of what happened at Fukushima Daiichi, how if survived the
earthquake and the overall effect has been nothing compared to the death and loss of
life from the tsunami.
Well, he mentioned in an article that he wrote yesterday that he talked to Caroline Lucas,
the head of the green party in the U. K. And he asked her why she would support subsidies
on solar and wind. She goes "I oppose subsides for nuclear but I support them for solar and
wind because nuclear is an established industry and solar and wind are still developing industries,
and they need public support in order to flourish. "And so George, a very smart guy, said" Will
you support research into thorium reactors, which could provide a much safer and cheaper
means of producing nuclear power? "
No, because thorium reactors are not a proven technology.
On an individual level we are seeing a lot of people change their minds. But at the organizational
level we 're not seeing any change. The people who run the environmentalist organizations,
and that 's unfortunate.
Have you had a one - on - one where you are talking to someone and they get this?
It 's tough for people who are further up the food chain in these organizations to come
out and make public policy statements. A lot of people get it one - on - one but they 're afraid
to be the first one to stand up and say "Ra - ra - ra, let 's go do this." It' s a lot easier when
you feel like everybody else is behind you.
Why are appeals to technological advancements always made with regards to solar and wind?
It 's going to get better it' s going to get cheaper, it 's going to get more efficient.
Don 't worry about what we have now, cause it' s going to be better next year. But yet
nuclear is assigned this position back in the '50s where it can never get better, it
can never incorporate a new technology, it can never improve and we won 't even entertain
if it does get any better.
Nuclear right now means water cooled reactor, uranium oxide solid fuel, poor fuel efficiency
and steam turbine. That 's what nuclear power means right now. So people look at Fukushima
Daiichi and they go, "Is this the end of nuclear power?" and I go, "No, it 's not the end of
nuclear power, there 's a zillion other ways to do nuclear power. "
The reactor that we worked on is cooled by a liquid salt, a nuclear fuel in the form
of solid pebbles.
They 're cooled by fluoride salts, but the fuel is not dissolved in the salts, it' s in
a solid form.
I was invited to the director 's office. The physicist there telling me, "What you have
invented is a new thorium uranium - 233 breeder. "Have you ever heard of about EXYDER, of course
not.
Just imagine what would happen if there was a light water reactor where the nuclear steam
supply system was in a single vessel, no piping penetrations in excess of about three inches
in diameter. I 'm working on that exact reactor.
From their reaction to Fukushima, it was an indication that people didn 't understand the
options around nuclear. Updating the old infrastructure will increase the safety standards significantly.
Generation two and three are still operational, generation 3. 5 is what 's being built right
now and generation four has higher safety standards, easier to build and so cheaper
to build better fuel utilization, drastically cheaper energy, even safer reactors.
Maybe there 's a better way, if you can figure out how to do this better, I will be happy
to get off LFTR and go do whatever that is better. This is the best way I 've be able
to come up with so far.
Can you do a recap on what the study said?
The title of the study was "Thorium was no panacea for nuclear energy." They were trying
to point out the deficiencies in thorium.
I didn 't think they were applying a very fair logic to it because they would say "Thorium
in a solid fuel reactor would do blah blah blah. See that 's not very good so thorium' s
dumb. "
Well no, thorium 's dumb in a solid fuel reactor. Not "thorium' s dumb."
If you 're going go out there try to put something out to the public saying "I' m going to authoritatively
refute the use of thorium as an energy source, "then it behooves you to do your homework.
Is it safe as it sounds what 's preventing North American governments from actually creating
the reactor? What 's the scary thing about it?
Ah, you 're thinking like me 10 years ago, you' re looking for a reason why not, I don 't
think there is a reason why not. There may be a reason why they may not be excited to
do it.
But there 's no reason why they can' t do it.
If I 'm a company that' s building CANDUs or light - water reactors, what competitive advantage
do I have by pursuing this other direction? Probably don 't have any.
There 's such a thing as nuclear hacking, it' s what this whole thing is about, because we 're
not talking about nuclear technology the way it 's done now, we' re talking about a completely
different approach to nuclear energy.
So maybe we 'll look back in the future and it' s meetings and gatherings like this we 'll
go "Man, that was where it got started. It didn 't get started at Westinghouse or Atomic
Energy of Canada, or GE, "there 's a ton we could do in this reactor that would even involve
the radioactive materials. All the stuff like the power conversion system all the chemistry,
that could all be done non - nuclear.
I don 't have a lot of faith that the current nuclear institutions, to be honest, what exactly
do we want from them? I mean all of their technology is based around technology that
isn 't what' s going to go into this machine.
We want the fact they have the ear of governments and very large banks.
OK, how many - we 're not exactly building lots of nuclear reactors right now. All their money
now is coming off fuel supply contracts. That 's how GE and Westinghouse make money on nuclear
power today, they don 't build reactors, they sell fuel. Now 30 years ago they were building
reactors, but that 's not really going on right now.
So their business model is overwhelmingly dominated by fuel fabrications. Come on now
you say, "Guess what I got a reactor it 's got no fuel fabrication to it," you just upended
their business model.
In the United States we 're building two reactors right now. We' re going to shut down more reactors
than that in a few years. We 're not getting ahead of anything, we' ll be lucky to hold
the line. I don 't even think we' re going to be able to do that.
What about in developing countries like China and India?
China 's ripping it up, China' s building like 50 reactors right now.
But even China 's realized, "We can' t built reactors based around water cooling and uranium
oxide fuel, it 's not going last that long. "China' s doing LFTR, even as we speak.
I found that ago a few months ago.
Where are they getting the blueprints? Or are they developing them?
Well, I mean they 've probably got a whole bunch of stuff from the PDFs on my website.
It 's been in the public domain for an awful long time. I just made it a little easier
to get.
This was about 10 years ago. I got in the car, I lived in Alabama and I was able to
go up to Oak Ridge then talk to some of the people there. And I said "Hey, I 've heard
that you guys long time ago did this really, really cool thing. What 's going on? "and they' re
like "Yeah, long time ago we did a really, really cool thing and everybody that did it
is either retired or dead now. "
I 'm like "Oh, well, that' s not good. What can we do?" and they said "Well, they wrote
a lot of papers and they wrote a lot of reports. "I said" Oh, OK. Can I get them? "" Oh yeah "
then they took me to this file cabinet and it was like full of stuff. And PDF 'd - not
everything but most of it, about two - thirds of it.
So, I had this stack of CD 's and I thought "Oh!" Send a copy to the Secretary of Energy,
send a copy to the Director of National Labs, send it all out to these different places
just sure they were going to get CDs from a random person and put them in their computer
and study them extensively - all five Gigabytes of them - and come to the same conclusion
I had and change national policy. I mean, of course, right? If we do not get this message
out to everyone, then nothing 's going to change.
In early 2010 EFT bloggers noticed that all these guys who were trying signing up from
Shanghai, Beijing and they started asking questions about this and that.
They went to Oak Ridge. They took them around the lab and showed them everything. And it 's
funny going to Oak Ridge because they 're all about the info and the nano and the bio and
you want to go, "What about the nuclear?" They never talk about that part. Well, we
get to the end of the trip and the Chinese official 's name was Dr. Jiang Mianheng...
interesting about Dr. Jiang Mianheng, his father was Jiang Zemin, who used to be the
premier of China. So, this is not a poorly - placed guy in Chinese society.
Trained in the United States in Pennsylvania.
PhD in Electrical Engineer from Drexel University; very, very bright guy.
They were under a non - disclosure agreement between RGOE and the Chinese government.
So they get to the end of the meeting and I 'm told by Oak Ridge people "You know we
had this great trip. Have you learned what you wanted to learn? "and they go" We 're actually
here to learn about the molten salt reactor. You see, we 're going to build one - we' ve
already got a site picked out - and we 're going to have it built by 2020 and we' re here
to learn everything we can about it. "And in Oak Ridge we were like" Huh... "
Anybody have their earphones in their ears while I 've been talking to try and drown me
out? Older folks like me will recall a day when earphones didn 't look like that. The
whole trick has been the invention of a little magnet based on neodymium, neodymium - iron - boron
magnets. Extremely powerful magnets, and they use a rare earth mineral called neodymium.
And because neodymium - iron - boron magnets are so powerful one of the places they find application
is in the generators that sit on top of windmills.
Global demand for wind has really increased desire to find neodymium.
Currently it 's all being mined in China. Now why am I talking about neodymium?
Well, because thorium is always found with heavy rare earth elements. If you remember
your periodic table, the lanthanides that column above the actinides, those are all
the rare earths.
Thorium policy in all western nations undermines the successful development of a domestic rare
earth market. All of the rare earths that most western mining companies are willing
to process are what they call bastnasites or carbonatites. They typically select these
rare earths not because of the high ratios of rare earths but simply the absence of thorium.
So consequently the only operating rare earth mine that just opened up this year, according
to their own filings in the USGS, produces essentially the lighter half of the lanthanide
scale and in fact does have some monazites, which are a thorium rare earth enriched mineralization,
which they dispose of.
So what happens all across America, Canada, and South America, there are beautiful monazite
deposits that have heavy rare earths which could be very commercial except for the thorium
content.
Mountain Pass was originally closed, according to CEO Mark Smith, because of the EPA and
the state of California and some thorium that came out of a ruptured tailing site. Thorium
represents this unknown and unlimited liability to rare earth production, so it plays into
the hands of China.
First, China provided rare earth elements very cheaply to everybody in the world by
their cheap labor, lack of enforceable environmental regulations, and their appreciate currency.
Essentially, consolidate and control the rare earth market.
And then they said, "Well, now all of you are coming to our door to buy our rare earths.
We don 't want to sell the raw material anymore. Our manufacturers can buy it cheaper. "
They impose a huge export tax on rare earth elements. So, one had a choice to accept a
huge tax and an increase in the price of the product or relocate factory into mainland
China and buy rare earth elements on the local market without tax.
It 's a strategy and it' s working pretty well.
Manufacturers which use rare earth elements in their products relocated their manufacturing
base inside China. The jobs in manufacturing transferred from the United States and western
Europe into the Chinese mainland.
They 've moved all the way up the value chain and are actually able to leverage their position
into capturing other countries I. P. If Toyota really wants to build a million battery packs,
in the end, if they don 't find a solution to the heavy rare earth problem, they' ll be
building them inside China.
So what we need to be able to do is let another entity take that thorium, develop uses and
markets, including energy.
So, let 's say, for example, you' ve got a single rare earth refinery creating about 20, 000
tons of heavy rare earths a year. On current consumption, that 's about 130 percent of domestic
consumption for rare earths. That automatically undermines China 's advantage. Now, there' s
two places on the planet Earth where you have a guaranteed supply of heavy rare earths.
What can your country leverage that into? This is the fulcrum you need to get back into
the world economy as a manufacturer.
Since 99 percent of the rare earths that we use, including those magnets? Well, when those
got mined, there was probably some thorium that came up with it that 's probably sitting
in some barrels over in China right now, waiting for Dr. Jhang to finish his experiments with
thorium molten salt reactors and to start putting them to use.
This is the most important thing that 's going to happen in the next 24 months, and whoever
gets that is essentially going to control the destiny and the roll out of energy for
the foreseeable future.
They need to be able to realize the promise of thorium. But, I 'd also like to see us succeed,
you know? We were working on this stuff a long time ago, we made great progress on it.
We set it down in 1974 for kind of dumb reasons, and I think it 's high time that we picked
that thread back up again.
Energy seems to correlate with influence. People who have energy, which used to be the
U. S., we had a lot of influence, now, there are others who have a lot of energy, and they
seem to be gaining influence.
The real question is whether the U. S. is missing a strategic national security opportunity.
We can either be on the wagon or we can buy foreign reactors in the future.
The worldwide energy business is about a three trillion dollar a year business. And an awful
lot of folks' wealth and power rides on the business of moving large amounts of hydro - carbon
from one place to another.
You 're on a billion, million dollar idea here. And to switch over from fuels like oil, gas,
uranium, do you worry that might be a possible problem?
I 'm a lot more worried about someday looking at our descendants and have them say, "Why
did you give us this world that we have now? Why did you give us this world of energy poverty,
of pollution, of war, of disease, when you knew there was a better way and you could
have made it happen? Why didn 't you do it? "
That 's the same question we' d ask these guys if we could go back to 1969, right? "Why didn 't
you do this? You knew about it, you could have made it happen, but you didn 't. What' s
your excuse? "
Human beings have been superstitious and fearful for most of their history. An era of enlightenment
has been a relatively short space of human history, and by no means assured that it will
continue in that manner.
I really believe that if we don 't have access to affordable and clean energy, we will revert.
We will go back to the way humans had been for thousands and thousands of years, which
is where the powerful and the rich oppress the masses, who lived terrible lives trying
to provide things for just a few people.
We will literally not only revert to barbarism but revert to social institutions like slavery.
And I mean that with all seriousness.
You only have a limited amount of money, you want to reduce greenhouse gases, so you want
to apply the dollars in ways that reduce greenhouse gases the most while creating the most employment
possible for that investment.
But, all the jobs that they create have to be built into the price of the power they
provide. Yeah, it would provide a lot of jobs but it 's at the expense of the people that
use the energy.
If we can provide an energy source cheaper than from coal, all the nations, in their
own economic self - interest, will choose it over coal.
Nuclear energy is not terribly reliable.
It 's a turbine that we just take from a gas plant and suspend it from a big scaffolding,
a tower, and surround it by giant mirrors in the desert. If a cloud passes over, or
during the evening, the utility wants a base load. And the way that we 're going to deliver
that base load is by powering it with gas. We 're building these all over the country,
and one of the questions we ask, we need about 3, 000 foot in altitude. We need flat land,
we need 300 days of sunlight, and we need to be near a gas pipe.
Hugely expensive capital costs.
Here are four independent proposals to build molten salt reactors and their dates. The
median is $1. 98.
You look at a LFTR for one to two dollars a watt, you 're looking at a full cost there,
because the fuel cost is so close to zero that you can safely ignore it.
Nuclear energy only produces electricity.
Now all our reactors today use steam turbines. Now we don 't use that because we' re stupid,
we use it because the limitations of pressurized water mean that you can 't get it all that
hot. I mean, the reactor just doesn 't get that hot.
With this reactor, we can get up to more like 700 or 800C, and at those temperatures, the
gas turbine turns out to be a better fit. So you can generate electricity from the gas
turbine, and you 've got to cool the gas, and every thermodynamic cycle has to reject waste
heat.
Almost no economic penalty to desalinate sea water.
Or we might try to synthesize fuel. We can configure it, not to produce electricity,
but to dissociate water. You can make ammonia out of hydrogen, which could be a fuel. It 's
also a fertilizer. Ammonia production consumes more than one percent of the entire world
energy budget today.
It 's about 14 years from when you put the project forward to when it' s built, and it 's
famous for cost overruns.
We used to build small reactors in a short period of time. May of 1961, Congress funded
Camp Century in Greenland.
The assembly is still subcritical. We began to transfer the fuel elements one by one,
and started loading the reactor core.
The reactor was operating under the ice 18 months later.
The Brayton cycle uses an inert gas, so you don 't have to worry about fuel explosions,
you get more efficiency out of the turbine side, and the turbines are smaller and cheaper
to build.
The risk of accidents
We can achieve safety for less cost because we 're moving to passive safety rather than
engineered safety. We see this trend with reactors like AP1000 but the LFTR can take
it to a much higher level.
Commercial nuclear energy around the world has a very good safety record even if you
include Chernobyl. The number of deaths from nuclear power plant accidents is less than
a hundred around the world, ever.
Just last year we had a natural gas explosion at a clean energy facility in Middletown,
CT that killed seven people, a coal dust and methane explosion at the Upper Big Branch
coal mine which killed 29 people, and a methane explosion in Deepwater Horizon that killed
11 people. San Bruno fire, which was a natural gas pipeline running underneath a neighborhood
and it blew up and killed about eight people and destroyed 50 homes.
Why do you pick nuclear power to pick on? Why don 't you pick on gas transmission? Why
don 't you pick on all these other sources of actual deaths?
Long lived nuclear waste that has to be kept out of the biosphere for over a quarter of
a million years.
Really most of that waste is unburned fuel. There are ways to reprocess it and burn more,
but it 's quite expensive and it' s not economically advantageous in today 's reactors. The breakthrough
in going to fluid fuels means you don 't have to reprocess or recycle, you leave the nuclear
fuel in the reactor until it 's burned up.
They remain in the salt and they decay in the salt until they give off all their decay
heat.
Here 's our transuranics - these figures show 10 ^ - 7, 10 ^ - 4, 10 ^ - 7, 10 ^ - 9 grams, this is
teeny teeny production. A thousandths of a gram of these dreaded materials in 10 years
of operation. This is good. Waste profile, much healthier.
The risk of nuclear proliferation
The proliferation hardening on this one, U - 232, we 've got protactinium. It sends out a bright
gamma cascade, so if somebody tries to run off with it we can catch them pretty easily.
You don 't even have to look at those issues for nuclear to fail.
The petrochemical industry, the hydrocarbon industry spends a lot of money advertising.
They believe in wind and the sun. Exxon is talking about growing algae, all kinds of
alternatives. You 'll never hear a hydrocarbon company talking about nuclear.
You 'll see an awful lot of stories of somebody in the gas or oil industry working against
nuclear and trying to raise the barriers of entry. That 's a simulated nuclear fuel pellet.
It 's as much energy as a ton of coal, 147 gallons of oil, or 17, 000 cubic feet of natural
gas.
If you 're making money selling hydrocarbons, you' re going to make less money.
I was born the year they canceled this research in Tennessee. I feel like all I 've done with
the blog, is I 've stood up and said, "Here' s this amazing work that was done before I was
even born. "
This is laws of physics stuff. I didn 't invent it, all I do promote it. Maybe I' ll never
see it happen in my life, but somebody will do it. Once people have learned how to do
it, they 'll keep using it, because it will make that much of difference.
Other people who are a whole lot smarter than me have looked at it and said, "This looks
darn pretty good, why aren 't we doing this? "
How long do you think it 's going to take?
At the rate we 're going now in the United States it' ll never happen. But, that 's going
to change.
We 're going to make it happen. I think in 10 years we will be building LFTRs in factory
assembly lines.
We can be competitive with China on making patents on things that weren 't thought of
in the 50 's and 60' s. But, if we wait, Americans, Canadians, and Brazilians will be buying LFTR
and molten salt technology from China and paying them the royalties.
We buy a lot of things from China already. It 's not as if we' re not buying enough things
from China. We are definitely keeping them busy. Let 's go develop thorium. That' s really
what I 'd like to do.
If everyone in the world has a lifestyle like you and I can enjoy in Canada and U. S. today,
we can have world peace and we can specialize on what areas we 're good at, and trade with
one another, and not fight over limited resources.
I think things will proceed different this time than they did in the 50 's and 60' s. Back
in the 50 's and 60' s, you had government appropriations to national labs, which lead to the development
of this technology. I don 't think that' s how it 's going to happen this time. I think it' s
going to be a fusion of the enthusiasts and private industry.
Enough people now, thanks to the Internet, are learning about the potential of LFTR and
thorium, and they 're asking hard questions.
Mr. President, you often say there are no silver bullets to our energy problems. Why
is the federal government not accelerating research into fluid fuel molten salt reactors
that run on thorium?
Liquid fluoride thorium reactors, this is the kind...
You 're already above my pay grade so...
I 'll explain it to you because this is the kind of idea Washington needs to know about.
Pretty soon in 10 years we 're going to buying these things from them if we don' t start making
them right now.
The AEC report given to John F. Kennedy at his request in 1962, addresses directly the
fears that they had, and it specifically outlines what we should have done. We have not done
it. We can do the thorium breeder reactor which Weinberg and the Ornell team worked
on for 20 years and perfected and operated for four years in the 1960 's.
That reactor is exactly what China now has a billion dollars to develop using our plans,
all our research, everything that we did as an American research institution 49 years
ago. Even if Washington does operate slowly, 49 years does sound to be a little excessive.
If we don 't do it, it will still be happening. It will just be happening in a place like
China rather than the United States. We will be seeing LFTRs being built in the future,
make no mistake.
A lot of environmentalists who are always trying to drive us towards using less energy,
because all that energy 's coming from the consumption of fossil fuel.
Well, let 's say your energy' s not coming from the consumption of fossil fuel. Then you could
use more energy, and you could use more energy to accomplish things that you are not able
to do right now. Break up carbon dioxide and dissociate water. Make fertilizer, grow crops,
all that.
So much energy, an abundance of energy, that it would drive the price down to the point
where the only oil we 'd be taking out of the ground would be the easy to get to oil. And
there 's not going to be any more environmental devastation than there already is.
If we didn 't have to worry about energy, we could think of so many more things to do.
If there was a lot of it and it was cheap and it was not harmful to the environment,
what would you do that you 're not doing now?
The thing that caught my eye when I was still in high school was the idea of a space solar
power satellite. Gerard O 'Neill The High Frontier. His idea was we were going to go build these
colonies. It was going to be like living in a shopping mall in space.
You know and, have a little home in the tube.
I don 't think we' re ready to live in space yet. We have not learned how to live in a
way where we recycle much more of our... I mean, if you want to live in space, you 've
got to recycle everything.
It seemed like the liquid fluoride thorium reactor, or LFTR, could be the power source
that could make a self - sustainable lunar colony a reality. But I have a simple question. If
it was such a great thing for a community on the moon, why not a community on the earth,
self - sustaining and energy independent?
Think about "Star Trek." You can 't help but think about "Star Trek" when your name' s Kirk.
What is the world of "Star Trek" running on? Are they running "Star Trek" on coal? Are
they running "Star Trek" on oil sands? No. You don 't see any oil refineries on
"Star Trek". You don 't see any coal mines.
We live much better lives today because we have learned how to use carbon. OK, what about
thorium? Thorium has a million times the energy density of a carbon - hydrogen bond. What could
that mean for human civilization going out thousands, tens of thousands of years into
the future? Because, we 're not going to run out of this stuff. Once we' ve learned how
to use it at this kind of efficiency, we will never run out.

In the last video we did a couple of lattice multiplication problems
and we saw it was pretty straightforward.
You got to do all your multiplication first
and then do all of your addition.
Well, let 's try to understand why exactly it worked.
It almost seemed like magic.
And to see why it worked I 'm going to redo this problem up here
and then I 'll also try to explain what we did in the longer problems.
So when we multiplied twenty - seven - -
so you write your two and your seven just like that - - times forty - eight.
I 'm just doing exactly what we did in the previous video.
We drew a lattice, gave the two a column and the seven a column.
Just like that.
We gave the four a row and we gave the eight a row.
And then we drew our diagonal.
And the key here is the diagonals, as you can imagine,
otherwise we wouldn 't be drawing them.
So you have your diagonals.
Now the way to think about it
is each of these diagonals are a number place.
So for example, this diagonal right here, that is the ones place.
The next diagonal, I 'll do it in this light green color.
The next diagonal right here in the light green color,
that is the tens place.
Now the next diagonal to the left or above that, depending on how you want to view it,
I 'll do in this little pink color right here.
You could guess, that 's going to be the hundreds place.
And then, finally, we have this little diagonal there,
and I 'll do it in this light blue color.
That is the thousands place.
So whenever we multiply one digit times another digit,
we just make sure we put it in the right bucket
or in the right place.
And you 'll see what I mean in a second.
So we did seven times four.
Well, we know that seven times four is twenty - eight.
We just simply wrote a two and an eight just like that.
But what did we really do?
And I guess the best way to think about it, this seven - -
this is the seven in twenty - seven.
So it 's just a regular seven. Right?
But this four, it 's the four in forty - eight.
So it 's not just a regular four, it' s really a forty.
Forty - eight can be rewritten as forty plus eight.
This four right here actually represents a forty.
So right here we 're not really multiplying seven times four,
we 're actually multiplying seven times forty.
And seven times forty isn 't just twenty - eight, it' s two hundred eighty.
And two hundred eighty, how can we think about that?
We could say that 's two hundreds plus eight tens.
And that 's exactly what we wrote right here.
Notice: this column - - I 'm sorry, this diagonal right here,
I already told you, it was the tens diagonal.
And we multiplied seven times forty.
We put the eight right here in the tens diagonal.
So that means eight tens.
Seven times forty is two hundreds.
We wrote a two in the hundreds diagonal.
And eight tens.
That 's what this two eight here is.
We actually wrote two hundred and eighty.
Let 's keep going.
When I multiply two times four.
You might say, oh, two times four, that 's eight.
But what am I really doing?
This is the two in twenty - seven.
This is really a twenty and this is really a forty.
So twenty times forty is equal to just eight with two zeros.
Is equal to eight hundred.
And what did we do?
We multiplied two times four and we said, oh, two times four is eight.
We wrote a zero and an eight just like that.
But notice where we wrote the eight.
We wrote the eight in the hundreds diagonal.
Let me make this a different color.
We wrote it in the one hundreds diagonal.
So we literally wrote - -
even though it looked like we multiplied two times four and saying it 's eight,
the way we accounted for it,
we really did twenty times forty is equal to eight hundreds.
Remember, this is the hundreds diagonal,
this whole thing right there.
And we can keep going.
When you multiply seven times eight.
Remember, this is really seven - - well, this is the seven in twenty - seven,
so it 's just a regular seven.
This is the eight in forty - eight, so it 's just a regular eight.
Seven times eight is fifty - six.
You write a six in the ones place.
Fifty - six is just five tens and one six.
So it 's five tens in the tens diagonal and one six. Fifty - six.
Then when you multiply two times eight,
notice, that 's not really just two times eight.
I mean we did write it 's just sixteen when we did the problem over here,
but we 're actually multiplying twenty.
This is a twenty times eight.
Twenty times eight is equal to one hundred sixty.
Or you could say it 's one hundred - -
notice the one in the one hundreds diagonal - - and six tens.
That 's what one hundred sixty is.
So what we did by doing this lattice multiplication,
is we accounted all the digits. The right digits in the right places.
We put the six in the ones place.
We put the six, the five, and the eight in the tens place.
We put the one, the eight, and the two in the hundreds place.
And we put nothing right now in the thousands place.
Then, now that we 're done with all the multiplication,
we can actually do our adding up.
And then you just keep adding,
and if there 's something that goes over to the next place,
you just carry that number.
So six in the ones place, well, that 's just a six.
Then you go the tens place.
Eight plus five plus six is what?
Eight plus five is thirteen.
Plus six is nineteen.
But notice, we 're in the tens place.
It 's nineteen tens or we could say it' s nine tens and one hundred.
We carry the one up here, if you can see it, into the hundreds place.
Now we add up all the hundreds.
One hundred plus two hundred plus eight hundred plus one hundred.
Or, what is this?
One thousand two hundred.
So you write two in the hundreds place.
One thousand two hundred is the same thing as two hundreds plus one thousand.
And now you only have one thousand in your thousands diagonal.
And so you write that one right there.
That 's exactly how we did it.
The same reasoning applies to the more complex problem.
We can label our places.
This was the ones place right there.
And it made sense.
When we multiplied the nine times the seven,
those are just literally nines and sevens. It 's sixty - three.
Six tens and three ones.
This right here is the tens diagonal.
Then we got six tens and three ones.
When we multiplied nine times eighty - - remember, seven hundred eighty - seven,
that 's the same thing as seven hundreds plus eight tens plus seven, just regular seven ones.
So this nine times eight is really nine times eighty.
Nine times eighty is seven hundred twenty.
Seven hundreds - - this is the hundreds place.
Seven hundreds and twenty - - two tens just right there.
And you can keep going.
This up here, this is the thousands place.
This is the ten thousands.
I 'll write it like that.
This is the hundred thousands place.
And then this was the millions place.
So we did all of our multiplication at once,
and accounted for things in their proper place based on what those numbers really are.
This entry right here,
it looks like we just multiplied four times eight and got thirty - two,
but we actually were multiplying four hundred - - this is a four hundred - - times eighty.
And four hundred times eighty is equal to three two and three zeros.
It 's equal to thirty - two thousand.
And the way we counted for it - - notice, we put a two right there,
and what diagonal is that?
That is the thousands diagonal.
So we say it 's two thousand and three ten thousands.
So three ten thousands and two thousands.
That 's thirty - two thousand.
So hopefully that gives you an understanding.
I mean it 's fun to maybe do some lattice multiplication and get practice.
But you know sometimes it looks like this bizarre magical thing.
But hopefully from this video you understand that all it is
is just a different way of keeping track of where the ones, tens, and hundreds place are.
With the advantage that it 's kind of nice
and compartmentalized, it doesn 't take up a lot of space.
And, it allows you to do all your multiplication at once,
and then, switch your brain into addition and carrying mode.


We 're asked to compute 3, 060 divided by 36.
We want to figure out how many times does 36 - - I don 't need
to write it that big.
We need to figure out how many times does 36 go into 3, 060.
Now, this is interesting because we 're dividing by a
two - digit number, by 36.
We 're going to see in this video that the process is the
exact same way.
There 's just going to be a little bit more mental
estimation going on, but we 'll do it explicitly here, so
hopefully, it won 't be too bad.
So we first look at 36, and we say, well, does 36 go into 3?
Well, no.
3 is smaller than 36, so it won 't go into 3.
Does 36 go into 30?
No, 30 is still smaller than 36, so it won 't go into that.
Does 36 go into 306?
Well, sure.
306 is larger than 36, and if we were to estimate it, 30
would go into 300 ten times, but this is larger than 30, so
it 's going to go fewer times.
Maybe it 's 9.
I 'm not sure.
Let 's try it out.
Let me try it out over on the side.
What is 36 times 9?
And this is kind of the art of doing these problems when
you 're dividing a two - digit number into something.
So 6 times 9 is 54.
Regroup, or carry the 5.
3 times 9 is 27, plus 5.
27 plus 5 is 32.
So 36 times 9 is 324.
That 's still larger than 306, so we' re going to have to go
36 less than that, so we 're going to
have to do eight times.
So we 're going to have to go into it eight times.
And remember, the way I thought about that is I said
my first guess was maybe it goes in nine times, but when I
tried out 36 times 9, that was still larger than 306.
That got me 324.
Eight times should work, because if you take 36 away,
if you only do 8 times 36, that 's going to
take us below 300.
342, 136 away from that, or another way, 324 minus 36 is
going to get us below 300.
So let 's try this out and just make sure.
8 times 6 is 48.
Put the 8 there; carry the 4.
8 times 3 is 24 plus 4 is 28.
So 8 times 36 is 288 and it fits.
It 's less than 306.
9 would 've been too much.
It would 've been greater than 306, so
now we can just subtract.

So we have 6 minus 8.
We can 't just subtract 8 from 6.
We have to do a little bit of regrouping.
Let 's get a 10 from the ones place right here, but we can' t
borrow anything from here or regroup anything from there,
so let 's go to the hundreds place.
Let 's take 1 from the hundreds place, and so this will become
a 2, and then this 0 here will become a 10.
Another way to think about it is this is now 10 tens.
We took 100 from there, and we 're now
writing 100 as 10 tens.
Or another way to think about it is you borrowed a 1, or you
took a 1, really.
You took a 1 from the hundreds place.
That made it into a 2, and then you put the 1 out in
front of the 0.
That 's kind of the process way of thinking about it.
Now, we have this 10 here, and now we can
borrow from this 10.
So let 's borrow from this 10.
So this 10 can become a 9.
1 is really taken from it, and then this 6 becomes a 16.
Because if you think about it, this 10 was really 10 tens.
It 's in the tens place, so when you put a 10 there, it
really means 10 tens.
So if you take 1 away from it, this is actually now 90, and
we have 10 to give to this 6, and 10 plus 6 is 16, so that 's
what we 're really doing.
But now we 're ready to subtract, so we have 16 minus
8 is 8, 9 minus 8 is 1, and 2 minus 2 is 0.
So we have 18 left over, and now we can bring down this 0
right here.
Bring down that 0.
So how many times does 36 go into 180?
And once again, this is going to be estimation.
It 's not going to be six times.
6 times 30 would be 180.
6 times 36 would be too big, because 36 is bigger than 30,
so let 's try 5.
Let 's see if 5 works.
So let 's see.
5 times 6 - - and there 's a little trial
and error here sometimes.
5 times 6 is 30.
Put the 0; carry the 3.
We don 't need that.
That 's from last time.
5 times 3 is 15 plus 3 is 18.
It looks like it works out.
You subtract 180 from 180, your get zero,
so we have no remainder.

So we 're left with 36 goes in 3, 060 eighty - five times.
So this is equal to 85.

Today 's lecture is what have we learned in entrepreneurship for the last 40 years.
One of the interesting questions is why are you here?
I hope you 're here to find out what does it take to go from an idea to a business.
For the last 20 years if you wanted to know how to go from an idea to a business,
the answer from educators and investors are simply, "Well, go research and then write
a business plan and you 'll know everything possible to actually start and run your business. "
We now know that advice was simply wrong - - not kind of wrong but very wrong.
We now today know something we didn 't know before.
We now know the right way to build startups and so this class is about that right way,
but before we get started, let 's see how we took the wrong path
and then see what we now know worse.

Let 's get started with some problems.
Let 's see.
First problem: what is fifteen percent of forty?
The way I do percent problems is I just convert the
percentage to a decimal and then I multiply it times the
number that I 'm trying to get the percentage of.
So 15% as a decimal is 0. 15.
You learned that from the percent to decimal conversion
video, hopefully.
And we just multiply this times forty.
So let 's say 40 times 0. 15.
five times zero is zero.
five times four is twenty.
Put a zero there.
And then one times zero is zero.
one times four is four.
And you get six zero zero.
Then you count the decimal spots.
one, two.
No decimals up there, so you go one, two and you
put the decimal there.
So 15% of 40 is equal to 0. 15 times 40, which equals 6. 00.
Well, that 's just the same thing as six.
Let 's do another problem.
Hopefully, that didn 't confuse you too much.
And I 'm going to try to confuse you this time just
in case you weren 't properly confused the last time.
What is 0. 2% of - - let me think of a number - - of 7.
So a lot of people 's inclinations would just
say, oh, 0. 2%, that 's the same thing as 0. 2.
And if that was your inclination you would be wrong.
Because remember, this isn 't 0. 2.
This is 0. 2%.
So there 's two ways of thinking about this.
You could say that this is 0. 2 / 100, which is, if you
multiply the numerator and denominator by ten, is the
same thing as two / one thousand.
Or you can just do the technique where you
move the decimal space over two to the left.
In which case, if you 're starting with 0. 2 and you
move the decimal space two to the left, you go bam.
Whoops!
Bam, bam.
That 's where the decimal goes.
So it 's 0. 002.
This is key.
0. 2% is the same thing as 0. 002.
This can always trip you up and I 've made this careless mistake
all the time, so don 't feel bad if you ever do it.
But just always pay careful attention if you see a
decimal and a percentage at the same time.
So now that we 've figured out how to write this percentage
as a decimal we just have to multiply it times the number
that we want to take the percentage of.
So we say 0. 002 times 7.
Well, this is pretty straightforward.
seven times two is fourteen.
And how many total numbers do we have or how many total
digits do we have behind the decimal point?
Let 's see.
It 's one, two, three.
So we need one, two, three digits behind the decimal point.
So 0. 2% of 7 is equal to 0. 014.
And you 're probably thinking, boy, that' s a really,
really small number.
And it makes sense because 0. 2%, if you want to
think about it, that 's smaller than even one percent.
So that 's even smaller than one / one hundred.
And actually, if you think about it, 0. 2% is 1 / 500.
And if you do the math, one / five hundred of seven will turn
out to be this number.
And that 's an important thing to do.
It 's always good to do a reality check because when
you 're doing these decimal and these percent problems, it' s
very easy to kind of lose a factor of ten here or there.
Or gain a factor of ten.
So always do a reality check to see if your answer makes sense.
So now I 'm going to confuse you even further.
What if I were to ask you four is twenty percent of what number?
So a lot of people 's reflex might just be,
oh, let me take twenty percent.
It becomes 0. 20.
And multiply it times four.
And in that case, again, you may be wrong.
Because think about it.
I 'm not saying what is twenty percent of four?
I 'm saying that twenty percent of some number is four.
So now we 're going to be doing a little bit of algebra.
I bet you didn 't expect that in the percent module.
So let x equal the number.
And this problem says that twenty percent of x is equal to four.
I think now it 's in a form that you might recognize.
So how do we write twenty percent as a decimal?
Well, that 's just 0. 20 or 0. 2.
And we just multiply it by x to get four.
So 20%, that 's the same thing as 0. 2.
It 's the same thing as 0. 20, but that last trailing
zero doesn 't mean much.
0. 2 times x is equal to 4.
And now we have a level one linear equation.
I bet you didn 't expect to see that.
So what do we do?
Well there 's two ways to view it.
You can just divide both sides of this equation
by the coefficient on x.
So if you divide 0. 2 here and you divide by 0. 2 here.
So you get x is equal to 4 divided by 0. 2.
So let 's figure out what 4 divided by 0. 2 is.
I hope I have enough space.
0. 2 goes into 4 - - I 'm going to put a decimal point here.
And the way we do these problems, we move the
decimal point here one over to the right.
So we just get a two and then we can move the decimal point
here one over to the right.
So this 0. 2 goes into 4 the same number of times
that two goes into forty.
And this is easy.
two goes into forty how many times?
Well, two goes into four two times and then two goes
into zero, zero times.
You could 've done that in your head.
two into forty is twenty times.
So 4 divided by 0. 2 is 20.
So the answer is four is twenty percent of twenty.
And does that make sense?
Well, there 's a couple of ways to think about it.
twenty percent is exactly one / five.
And four times five is twenty.
That makes sense.
If you 're still not sure we can check the problem.
Let 's take twenty percent of twenty.
So 20% of 20 is equal to 0. 2 times 20.
And if you do the math that also will equal four.
So you made sure you got the right answer.
Let 's do another one like that.
I 'm picking numbers randomly.
Let 's say three is nine percent of what?
Once again, let 's let x equal the number that three is nine percent of.
You didn 't have to write all that.
Well, in that case we know that 0. 09x - - 0. 09, that 's the same
thing as nine percent of x - - is equal to three.
Or that x is equal to 3 divided by 0. 09.
Well, if we do the decimal division, 0. 09 goes into 3.
Let 's put a decimal point here.
I don 't know how many zero' s I 'm going to need.
So if I move this decimal over to the right twice, then I 'll
move this decimal over to the right twice.
So 0. 09 goes into 3 the same number of times
that nine goes into three hundred.
So nine goes into thirty three times.
three times nine is twenty - seven.
I think I see a pattern here already.
thirty, three, three times nine is twenty - seven.
You 're going to keep getting thirty - three - - the three' s are just
going to go on forever.
So it turns out that three is nine percent of - - you can either write it as
33. 3 repeating or we all know that 0. 3 forever is the
same thing as one / three.
So three is nine percent of thirty - three and one / three.
Either one of those would be an acceptable answer.
And a lot of times when you 're doing percentages you' re
actually just trying to get a ballpark.
The precision might not always be the most important thing,
but in this case we will be precise.
And obviously, on tests and things you need to
be precise as well.
Hopefully, I didn 't go too fast and you have a good
sense of percentage.
The important thing for these type of problems is pay
attention to how the problem is written.
If it says find ten percent of one hundred.
That 's easy.
You just convert ten percent to a decimal and multiply it by one hundred.
But if I were to ask you one hundred is ten percent of what?
You have to remember that that 's a different problem.
In which case, one hundred is ten percent of - - and if you did the math,
it would be one thousand.
I think I spoke very quickly on this problem on this module, so
I hope you didn 't get too confused.
But I will record more.


I 'll now show you how to convert a fraction
into a decimal.
And if we have time, maybe we 'll learn how to do a
decimal into a fraction.
So let 's start with, what I would say, is a fairly
straightforward example.
Let 's start with the fraction 1 / 2.
And I want to convert that into a decimal.
So the method I 'm going to show you will always work.
What you do is you take the denominator and you divide
it into the numerator.
Let 's see how that works.
So we take the denominator - - is 2 - - and we 're going to divide
that into the numerator, 1.
And you 're probably saying, well, how do I divide 2 into 1?
Well, if you remember from the dividing decimals module, we
can just add a decimal point here and add some trailing 0 's.
We haven 't actually changed the value of the number, but we' re
just getting some precision here.
We put the decimal point here.

Does 2 go into 1?
No.
2 goes into 10, so we go 2 goes into 10 five times.
5 times 2 is 10.
Remainder of 0.
We 're done.
So 1 / 2 is equal to 0. 5.

Let 's do a slightly harder one.
Let 's figure out 1 / 3.
Well, once again, we take the denominator, 3, and we divide
it into the numerator.
And I 'm just going to add a bunch of trailing 0' s here.
3 goes into - - well, 3 doesn 't go into 1.
3 goes into 10 three times.
3 times 3 is 9.
Let 's subtract, get a 1, bring down the 0.
3 goes into 10 three times.
Actually, this decimal point is right here.
3 times 3 is 9.
Do you see a pattern here?
We keep getting the same thing.
As you see it 's actually 0. 3333.
It goes on forever.
And a way to actually represent this, obviously you can 't write
an infinite number of 3 's.
Is you could just write 0. - - well, you could write 0. 33
repeating, which means that the 0. 33 will go on forever.
Or you can actually even say 0. 3 repeating.
Although I tend to see this more often.
Maybe I 'm just mistaken.
But in general, this line on top of the decimal means
that this number pattern repeats indefinitely.
So 1 / 3 is equal to 0. 33333 and it goes on forever.
Another way of writing that is 0. 33 repeating.
Let 's do a couple of, maybe a little bit harder, but they
all follow the same pattern.
Let me pick some weird numbers.

Let me actually do an improper fraction.
Let me say 17 / 9.
So here, it 's interesting.
The numerator is bigger than the denominator.
So actually we 're going to get a number larger than 1.
But let 's work it out.
So we take 9 and we divide it into 17.
And let 's add some trailing 0' s for the decimal point here.
So 9 goes into 17 one time.
1 times 9 is 9.
17 minus 9 is 8.
Bring down a 0.
9 goes into 80 - - well, we know that 9 times 9 is 81, so it has
to go into it only eight times because it can 't go
into it nine times.
8 times 9 is 72.
80 minus 72 is 8.
Bring down another 0.
I think we see a pattern forming again.
9 goes into 80 eight times.
8 times 9 is 72.
And clearly, I could keep doing this forever and
we 'd keep getting 8' s.
So we see 17 divided by 9 is equal to 1. 88 where the 0. 88
actually repeats forever.
Or, if we actually wanted to round this we could say that
that is also equal to 1. - - depending where we wanted
to round it, what place.
We could say roughly 1. 89.
Or we could round in a different place.
I rounded in the 100 's place.
But this is actually the exact answer.
17 / 9 is equal to 1. 88.
I actually might do a separate module, but how would we write
this as a mixed number?
Well actually, I 'm going to do that in a separate.
I don 't want to confuse you for now.
Let 's do a couple more problems.

Let me do a real weird one.
Let me do 17 / 93.
What does that equal as a decimal?
Well, we do the same thing.
93 goes into - - I make a really long line up here because
I don 't know how many decimal places we' ll do.

And remember, it 's always the denominator being divided
into the numerator.
This used to confuse me a lot of times because you 're often
dividing a larger number into a smaller number.
So 93 goes into 17 zero times.
There 's a decimal.
93 goes into 170?
Goes into it one time.
1 times 93 is 93.
170 minus 93 is 77.

Bring down the 0.
93 goes into 770?
Let 's see.
It will go into it, I think, roughly eight times.
8 times 3 is 24.
8 times 9 is 72.
Plus 2 is 74.
And then we subtract.
10 and 6.
It 's equal to 26.
Then we bring down another 0.
93 goes into 26 - - about two times.
2 times 3 is 6.
18.
This is 74.

0.
So we could keep going.
We could keep figuring out the decimal points.
You could do this indefinitely.
But if you wanted to at least get an approximation, you would
say 17 goes into 93 0. - - or 17 / 93 is equal to 0. 182 and
then the decimals will keep going.
And you can keep doing it if you want.
If you actually saw this on exam they 'd probably tell
you to stop at some point.
You know, round it to the nearest hundredths or
thousandths place.
And just so you know, let 's try to convert it the other way,
from decimals to fractions.
Actually, this is, I think, you 'll find a
much easier thing to do.
If I were to ask you what 0. 035 is as a fraction?
Well, all you do is you say, well, 0. 035, we could write it
this way - - we could write that 's the same thing as 03 - -
well, I shouldn 't write 035.
That 's the same thing as 35 / 1, 000.
And you 're probably saying, Sal, how did
you know it 's 35 / 1000?
Well because we went to 3 - - this is the 10 's place.
Tenths not 10 's.
This is hundreths.
This is the thousandths place.
So we went to 3 decimals of significance.
So this is 35 thousandths.
If the decimal was let 's say, if it was 0. 030.
There 's a couple of ways we could say this.
Well, we could say, oh well we got to 3 - - we went to
the thousandths Place.
So this is the same thing as 30 / 1, 000.
or.
We could have also said, well, 0. 030 is the same thing as
0. 03 because this 0 really doesn 't add any value.
If we have 0. 03 then we 're only going to the hundredths place.
So this is the same thing as 3 / 100.
So let me ask you, are these two the same?

Well, yeah.
Sure they are.
If we divide both the numerator and the denominator of both of
these expressions by 10 we get 3 / 100.
Let 's go back to this case.
Are we done with this?
Is 35 / 1, 000 - - I mean, it 's right.
That is a fraction.
35 / 1, 000.
But if we wanted to simplify it even more looks like we could
divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5.
And then, just to get it into simplest form,
that equals 7 / 200.
And if we wanted to convert 7 / 200 into a decimal using the
technique we just did, so we would do 200 goes into
7 and figure it out.
We should get 0. 035.
I 'll leave that up to you as an exercise.
Hopefully now you get at least an initial understanding of how
to convert a fraction into a decimal and maybe vice versa.
And if you don 't, just do some of the practices.
And I will also try to record another module on this
or another presentation.
Have fun with the exercises.


Where I left off, we were just essentially chugging through
this fairly hairy derivative - - this definite integral - -
this antiderivative.
It takes my brain a little while to come
up with the next term.
So we evaluated at 2 and now we have to subtract
this evaluated at 1.
So minus 16 pi minus 4 pi over 3 - - oh, sorry.
Plus.
The minus is going to be on everything.
Oh no, sorry.
That is a minus.
That 's a minus.
Plus 4 pi.
Right?
Because x is 1.
Minus pi over 2.
And now we can simplify it.
Let 's see what we can do.
The 16 pi minus 8 pi, that equals 8 pi.
And then that 's a plus.
The 32 plus 8 pi.
32 pi plus 8 pi, that equals 40 pi.
So let 's see, I' ve simplified it to 40 pi, and what 's minus
8 times 4 is 32 pi over 3.
And then, let 's see.
Minus 4 pi over 3 minus pi over 2.
So let 's get a common denominator for this
part right here.
So if I put everything over 6 - - 20 pi over 6 is the same thing
is 120 pi over 6, and then minus - - 4 pi over 3, if I put
it over 6 it becomes 8 pi over 6, right?
And then pi over 2, if I put it over 6 it becomes 3 pi over 6.
So minus 3 pi.
So this whole term that we 're going to have to subtract from
this term is equal to 120 minus 11, right?
So that 's 109 pi over 6.
This equals 1 - - is that right?
Yeah, 109 pi over 6.
See what happens when you make up problems on the fly?
You get ugly numbers.
109 pi over 6.
And what does that top part translate?
So this is what we 're going to subtract.
This is when we evaluated the antiderivative at 1.
And let 's simplify this one.
So that one, if we put 3 common denominator, that 's 120 pi
over 3 minus 32 pi over 3.
120 minus 32, let 's see, we get 90 - - 88?
Right.
88 pi over 3.
So that equals 88 pi over 3, and remember, that 's
just the top part.
And then - - this is more of a review of fractions than
anything else - - and then if I want to put it over
6, I just double it.
So I think we 're almost done.
Let me switch colors.
So if you go over a denominator of 6 - - 88
pi over 3 - - let 's see.
If I double that, I get 160 - - 176, right?
176 pi minus this.
Minus 109 pi.
I 'm sure I made a careless mistake.
These are my least favorite type of things to do.
Hairy fractions.
So 176 minus 109.
That 's the same thing as 76 minus 9.
And that is 65.
So our final answer is 65 pi over 6.
Which isn 't as hairy as it seemed when we
started the problem.
But that 's pretty neat.
This is kind of a strange shape.
It 's kind of a wide ring that has - - the upper part of the
ring and the inner part of the ring are hard edges.
But then it 's curved on the outside.
And we were able to figure out the volume of that.
Especially - - and what was weird about this, is when it was
rotated around the line y is equal to minus 2.
Hopefully I didn 't confuse you.
These are about as difficult as these volume of
revolution problems get.
If you want more, just let me know.

So this heap property is a really useful thing, it 's going to turn out.
It 's important to figure out how we can take a bunch of numbers
and make them satisfy the heap property.
Let 's do that. Let' s start figuring out how that will work.
First thing to notice is that any one - node tree satisfies the heap property
because it can 't be bigger or smaller than the parent or the child
cause it doesn 't have any parents or child.
That case is really easy, but now, so let 's imagine that we' ve somehow managed to create two heaps
and we 've like to join them together by adding another node and have it the heap property hold.
Both of these subtrees the heap property holds which means the smallest values in the entire heap
are sitting here at the top of the relative roots, but now we 're adding a new node.
If this node is already smaller, then these two, then everything 's fine but it might not be.
It might be that this is a large value.
Let 's give an example. So what do we do at this point?
We need a heap property to hold everywhere for this to actually be a heap. So what can we do?
Well, so with respect to these three nodes, we 're going to need to change something
to establish the heap property of this locally.
First thing we 're going to do is we' ll introduce some swapping around.
Which value can we swap to the top to move things in the direction of
more establishing the heap property?
Which of these values should be at the root here? Write the answer in the box.

And the second question asks what is the maximum number of edges B can have?

Today, we 're going to talk about resources, activities, and costs, and congratulations,
this is your last lecture. By now, you 're intimately familiar with the business model canvass.
We 've talked about value props, customer segments, channels, customer relationships,
revenue streams. We jumped ahead and talked about partners, and right now, we 're going to talk
about key resources. And for key resources, the real question is what are your most important assets
to make your business model happen? Let see what are some most important assets?
What are the most important things that are required to make your business model work?
For every startup, the thing you 're always worried about is money, finance.
How do you get the company started? Can you do that on your credit cards? Can you line a credit
to a small business loan or then physical resources. You need a manufacturing line.
You need machines. You need cars. You need vehicles. And, how about intellectual property?
Or pets? Critical to defending your position or is it customerless? Or should people?
And then that kind of get us into what are the key human resources you need to make this happen?
Is it the world 's best scientists? Or programmers? Or engineers? Is there a specific area in the
country that has a concentration of them. And, so when you think about resources some of these
are just kind of natural. All you have will hire a bunch of engineers and we 'll have a building, etc.
But actually, you could think about the strategic way. She is impossible to have headquarters in
one place like Silicon Valley, but great engineers back in our country somewhere in Finland or
Chile or Russia or these are physical manufacturing plant that is located in the United States or
do we need to put it in a place for lower cost manufacturer. And, so all these resources are the
things that you really need to think through even though what they want they might not seem
important. It just gets to be a bigger and bigger problem overtime. If you have an actual approach
to this dose of strategy at least giving it a couple of cycles when you start your company.

So this lecture is for facilitators and coaches, sometimes called the instructors or mentors.
Why you 're here is I' m just going to go through a brief explanation
of what it is you 're doing while the students are watching the lectures
and working on their presentations and getting out of the building and presenting.
What do you do?
My suggestion is to get us all aligned,
rather than me have to repeat all of the lectures we 're giving the students,
is you need to go watch Lecture 0, Lecture 1, Lecture 1. 5
and find your copy of the Lean LaunchPad Educators Guide.
That 's kind of your prep work for the rest of this conversation.
This might take an hour or 2 to watch all these lectures
and kind of get up to speed on the material, but it 's well worth your time.
Also, if you don 't have a copy, please get a copy of Alexander Osterwalder' s
Business Model Generation book and a copy of The Startup Owner 's Manual.

The answer is when you 're planning an initial product, the most important is finding
sufficient features to solve the problem for a known group of customers.
Matching competitive features is what we used to do and actually is a going out of business strategy.
And unless you 're in an existing market and you happen to know
which features the customers have told you are more important.
Having sufficient features to meet all of customer needs, startups just don 't have the resources to do
every possible wish that a customer has at least on day 1, and so really what you want to do
is focus on enough features to solve a problem important enough for a known group of customers.

Round 24, 259 to the nearest hundred.
You 're going to find that doing these problems are
think about what it means to round to the nearest hundred.
So what I 'm going to do is I' m going to draw a number line.
Let me draw a number line here, and I 'm just going to
mark off the hundreds on the number line.
So maybe we have 24, 100, and then we go to 24, 200, then we
go to 24, 300, and then we go to 24, 400.
I think you see what I mean when I 'm only
marking off the hundreds.
I 'm going up by increments of 100.
Now, on this number line, where is 24, 259?
So if we look at the number line, it 's more than 24, 200
and it 's less than 24, 300.
And it 's 259, so if this distance right here is 100, 59
is right about there, so that is where our number is.
That is 24, 259.
So when someone asks you to round to the nearest hundred,
they 're literally saying round to one of these increments of
100 or round to whichever increment of 100 that it is
closest to.
And if you look at it right like this, if you just eyeball
it, you 'll actually see that it is closer to 24, 300 than it
is to 24, 200.
So when you round it, you round to 24, 300.
So if you round to the nearest hundred, the answer
Now that 's kind of the conceptual understanding of
why it 's even called the nearest hundred.
The nearest hundred is 24, 300.
But every time you do a problem like this, you don 't
have to draw a number line and go through this whole process,
although you might want to think about it.
An easier process, or maybe a more mechanical process, is
you literally look at the number 24, 259.
We want to round to the nearest hundred, so you look
at the hundreds place.
This is the hundreds place right here, and when we round,
that means we don 't want any digits.
We only want zeroes after the hundreds place.
So what you do is you look at the place one less than the
place you 're rounding to.
This is the hundreds place so you look at the 5 right there,
and if this number is 5 or greater, if it 's 5, 6, 7, 8,
or 9, you round up.
So 5 or greater, you round up.
It is 5 or greater, so rounding up means that we go
to 24, 000, and since we 're rounding up, we make
the 2 into a 3.
We increment it by one, so rounding up, so 24, 300.
That 's what we mean by rounding up.
And just as kind of a counterexample, if I had
24, 249 and I wanted to round to the nearest hundred, I
would say, OK, I want to round to the nearest hundred.
Let me look at the tens place, this place one
level to the right.
And when you round down, be careful.
It doesn 't mean you decreases this 2.
It literally means you just only have the 2.
Just get rid of everything after it.
So it becomes 24, 200.
That 's the process where you round down.
If you round up, it becomes 24, 300.
And it makes sense.
24, 249 is going to be sitting right over here someplace, so
it 's going to be closer to 24, 200.
24, 200 would be the nearest hundred when we round
down in this case.
For the case of the problem, 24, 259, the
nearest hundred is 24, 300.

We 're asked to subtract, simplify the answer and write
as a mixed number.
So we have two mixed numbers here, and like when you 're
adding mixed numbers, you can do it two ways.
You can either turn both of these into improper fractions
and then subtract, or you can subtract the whole number part
and then the fraction part, so let 's do it that way.
So just to remind ourselves, 5 and 5 / 8 is the exact same thing
Let me write it here in yellow.
as 5 plus 5 / 8. These are the exact same thing.
and 1 / 5 is the exact same thing as 2 plus 1 / 5.
Now if we 're subtracting, that means we have to subtract 2
Distributive property.
We 're subtracting both of them.
So we get 5 plus 5 / 8, and then we distribute the negative sign,
We can say this is the same thing as... Let me do it in orange...
as 5 minus 2, that 's the whole number parts, and
then you have plus 5 / 8 minus 1 / 5.
Now, 5 minus 2, that 's pretty straightforward.
That 's just 3.
But what 's 5 / 8 minus 1 / 5?
Let 's do that over here.
So we have 5 / 8 minus 1 / 5.
Now, just like when you 're adding fractions, when you' re
8 and 5 are not the same denominator so we have to find
the least common multiple of these two numbers.
If we do a prime factorization of 8, you get 2 times 4.
4 is 2 times 2.
So 8 is 2 times 2 times 2.
That 's if you break it down into its constituent primes.
5 is just 5, because it is a prime number.
So the least common multiple of 8 and 5 has to have a 5 and
three 2 's in it.
Or another way of saying it, it has to be 5 times 2 times 2
times 2, which is the same thing as 5 times 8.
So the least common multiple is going to be - - because these
guys share no common factors other than 1 really.
Now, to go from 8 to 40, you have to multiply by 5.
So in either case, we 're multiplying times 5, the numerator and the denominator.
Now, to go from 5 to 40, we have to multiply by 8, so we
also have to do that for the numerator, so 1 times 8 is 8.
So now we have 25 / 40 minus 40 / 40, which would be equal
to - - we 're going to have 40 as the denominator.
25 minus 8 is 17.
So 5 / 8 minus 1 / 5, which is the same thing as 25 / 40 minus
8 / 40, is equal to 17 / 40.
And 17 is a prime number so it 's not going to share any
common factors with 40, or at least 40 isn 't divisible by 17
So this part, the [integer] part, is 3 and the fraction
part is 17 / 40. And we 're done
And this worked.
straightforward, because in this situation, the fraction
part that we 're subtracting from the other fraction part was smaller.
If it was larger, it would 've gotten a little bit messy.
Maybe we would have ended up with a negative number and we
would 've done all this other stuff, so that' s why sometimes
it 's easier to go straight to an improper fraction for both of them.
But in this case, it worked out doing it this way.

Hello.
We are now gonna do some slope and y intercept problems as well.
y - intercept problems as well.
Let 's get started.
So let me make up a problem.
Let 's say we have the points two, five.
The other point, let 's make that negative three, negative three.
Well, first let 's just graph those two points.
I 'm going to graph them in yellow.
So two, five.
Let 's see that' s one two.
One, two, three, four, five.
So two, five is going to be right over there.
OK.
And then let me graph negative three, negative three.
So it 's one, two, three.
One, two, three.
So negative three, negative three is right over there.
And then now let me draw a line that will connect them.
That 's my new technique.
I draw it in two pieces.
I think that 's good enough.
OK.
So let 's see if we can at least first figure out the slope of
the line, and then if we have time we 'll try to figure
out the y - intercept.
And then we 'll know the whole equation for the line.
Let me pick a slightly thinner color, and we 'll get started.
So the slope, if you saw the last module that just
introduces how we calculate the slope, that 's
just rise over run.
Or, change in y over change in x.
This is y.
So let 's just do that real fast.
So let 's take this as our starting point.
So change in y could be five - - remember, y is the
second coordinate - - five minus negative three.
And that 's this one.
Over - - now you do the change in x - - two minus, this
is also negative three.
Well five minus negative three, that 's five plus plus three.
So that equals eight.
And then two minus negative three.
Once again that 's two plus plus three, so that equals five.
So we figured out the slope of this equation.
It 's eight / five.
And let 's see if that makes sense.
Let 's figure out what the rise and the run is.
If we were to start at this point right here, let 's see how
much we have to rise to get to the same y - coordinate
as the other point.
So let 's see.
We 're here, and the other point is up here.
So let 's figure out what this distance is.
Actually, now is a good time to use the fat.
Oh man, I have a shaky hand.
OK.
Let 's figure out what that distance is.
That distance is delta y, which is change in y.
So it 's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
That equals eight.
And that makes sense, because if you think about it
what did we just do?
We just took y equals five, which was up here, minus
y equals negative three.
And so obviously we just calculated that distance
just by looking at the two coordinates five minus negative three.
When you do this calculation it actually gives you
this distance right here.
So that 's how we figure out how much we have to rise.
So now let 's do the run.
Well the run, to go from this point to the other
point, we went this far.
And let 's count how far that is.
Well, it 's one, two, three, four, five units.
So we can say delta x is equal to five.
And that 's exactly what we did. delta y over delta x was equal
to eight / five, or rise over run is equal to eight / five.
And it would have been the same thing if we calculated run here
or if we calculated rise here.
But it 's the same thing.
Hope that 's making sense to you.
And I hope that also makes sense that if the rise for a
given run becomes more, then the slope of the line is going
to become steeper and it 'll become a bigger number.
So let 's see what we have so far for the
equation of this line.
So so far we know the equation of this line is equal to, y is
equal to the slope eight / five x plus b.
So we 're almost done.
We just have to figure out this b right here.
Now that b, just so you remember, that 's
the y - intercept.
And that 's where we intersect the y - axis.
And since this graph is pretty neat, we can actually inspect
it and see that, well, it looks like we 're intersecting
the y - axis at two.
So my guess is we 're going to come up with b equals two.
But let 's solve it, just in case we didn' t have this
neatly drawn graph here.
So how can we solve for b?
Well, we can substitute values that we know
that work for x and y.
Well either of these points are on that line, so we can
substitute them in for x and y.
So let 's use the first one.
OK.
So the y we get five, will equal eight / five times x.
Well, x there is two.
Times two plus b.
Well, now we just get five is equal to sixteen / five plus b.
And then we get b equals - - well five is twenty - five / five, right?
five is twenty - five / five minus sixteen / five equals nine / five.
All right.
See, so I was actually wrong.
When I looked at this graph I said, oh that looks like
almost two, so yeah it 's probably going to be two.
But when we actually did it using algebra, when we did it
analytically, we actually saw that b is equal to nine / five.
So it 's almost two.
9 / 5 is 1 and 4 / 5, or 1. 8.
So that 's almost two, but it actually turns
out that it 's not.
It 's at 1. 8.
And I can write it down as a decimal.
1. 8.
So the final equation for the line, I 'm going to try to
squeeze it in at the bottom of this page, it 's going to be y
is equal to - - well, we know the slope.
eight / five x.
Now we just add the y - intercept.
Plus nine / five.
There.
We solved it.
Let 's do another one.
And so - - that 's nine / five.
I don 't want to be too repetitive.
Let 's do another problem.
Time to do another problem, and let me put that
graph back there again.
There you go.
All right.
I 'm going to think of two random numbers again.
Let me try to do this fast, because YouTube puts a
ten minute limit on me.
So let 's say I had the points two, negative three.
And I had the point negative four, five.
So two, negative three.
Let 's plot that sucker real fast.
So x is two, so it 's here.
And the negative three.
One, two, three.
So two, negative three is there.
And negative four, five.
So that 's one, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four, five.
I have to count like this because this
graph is unlabeled.
But if we actually were to draw in the coordinates you would
that see this is five, and this is negative four, and so on.
And this is two, and this is negative three.
And now let 's just draw a line.
Let 's draw it right there with my shaky hand.
OK.
There you go.
Good line.
And another good line.
All right.
So first we need to figure out the slope.
Well we could just do that doing the algebra.
So its slope is just delta - - I 'm still using the line tool
again - - delta y over delta x.
Change in y over change in x.
Let 's take this y as the first point now.
So we 'll say five minus this y, negative three.
Over - - now since we used the five first we have to use the
negative four first as well.
Negative four minus two.
Well five minus negative three, that equals eight.
And negative four minus two, well that equals negative six.
And negative eight / six, well that equals - - they 're
both divisible by two.
So that equals minus four / three.
And let 's see, does that make sense as the slope?
Well, if we were to go down four from this point.
So if the rise was negative four - - one, two, three, four.
So if we go down - - woops, I 'm using white.
So that 's why you can' t see it.
We go down by four here, and then we go to the right
three, positive three.
We still end up on the line.
So it works.
Looks good to me.
Let 's see if I can solve the y - intercept in thirty seconds.
Otherwise, I 'll start it on the next module.
So we get y is equal to minus four / three x, plus b.
And actually what we 'll do is we' ll leave off here, and I 'm
going to solve for b - - and you could try to do it on your
own - - in the next installment of this presentation.

Could you speculate a little bit about how a company like Facebook
could use information about things like users clicking on a like button on something
to suggest possibly people to be friends with?
[Tina] Right. A simple way is this idea that - -
Let 's assume we have Mary, John, and Jill.
And Mary is friends with John and Jill, but John and Jill are not friends with each other.
Every time Mary posts something, both John and Jill like it.
So, because they keep liking the things that Mary posts,
we think, wow, they should like each other as well and want to be friends.
In fact, another reason that it makes sense to have them be friends
is that they 're both friends with Mary,
and so they share a common friend and they like a lot of the stuff that Mary is posting.
So, that would be a good friend suggestion.
The more friends they have in common, the higher this idea
of, oh, they would want to be friends, because they share a lot of common friends.
This is a whole area called tie strength
about how strongly am I tied to you or would I be tied to you?
We actually recently had a paper at a web science conference on this.
When I actually go out of my way and like something,
it means that - - and you go out of your way and like it - -
it means that maybe we should be friends, because we like the same kinds of things.
It 's also connected to the concept of homophily - -
this idea of like attracting like.
It 's been around in history for a very long time.
In fact, it dates all the way back to Plato,
which says similarity begets friendship.
Or for example in more common day we say "Birds of a feather flock together."
In a social network, links tend to connect people who are similar to one another.
So, I 'm similar to you and so I would like to be your friend,
and so I have a link to you.
If, for example, you want to find out about whether I 'm a good guy or a bad guy,
you can look at my friends and see if the majority of them are good guys or bad guys.
If the majority of them are good guys, then you would guess, well, Tina must be a good guy,
because she 's friends with a lot of good guys.
And that 's where also this idea of egonets comes along.
An egonet is a term in sociology,
and it refers to the ego.
And then I have my alters, which are my friends.
So, my friends are my alters, and the person you 're considering is called the "ego."
The egonet is the network that connects the ego to the alters
and that connects the alters together.
You can have egonets that look like a star where you have the ego and the alters,
but none of the alters know each other.
Or you can have a clique where everybody knows each other in this egonet.
The ego obviously knows all the alters and is friends with all the alters
and all the alters are friends with each other.
In fact, going back to this idea of recommending links,
the closer - - the more cliquey - - your egonet is,
the more links there are in your egonet,
the more likely it is that the alters that aren 't connected with each other
would want to be connected to each other.
Now, we looked at something in the class called the clustering coefficient.
Is it safe to define that as the density of the connections among your alters?
Or, if you want to think about it, the number of triangles that exist, right?, in your egonet.
Selection is the tendency of people to form friendship with others who are like them.
If you wanted to target an outreach for a particular product,
you 're assuming that there is selection going on.
Influence is the fact that we 're already friends,
and people may change their behavior to bring them more closely
into alignment with their friends.
That 's where, for example, a lot of viral marketing is good for.
If you 're trying to push something where the underlying cause is social influence,
then you would want to go with viral marketing.
So, with selection the individual characteristics drive the formation of friendship links,
and then with influence is the existing links in the networks to people 's characteristics.
So, I buy iPhone and really like it. I play with it.
That influences you to go buy an iPhone.
Usually when people talk about influence they also talk about contagion.
It 's basically the same kind of term.
People use it interchangeably.
There was this very famous study back in 2007 that got a lot of publicity
that was done by Professor Christakis at Harvard
and Professor Fowler at University of California, San Diego,
and they looked at how obesity is caused by influence,
that obesity is contagious.
They have this thing where having an obese friend increases your chance
of obesity by 57%.
That was when it got like everything was contagion.
Happiness was contagious, everything was contagious.
There 's all these - - like Time magazine had a front cover,
and Wired magazine and all that.
Then when people looked more into the model they found that, well,
wait a second.
If I follow the model, then tallness is also contagious.
Unfortunately, it 's not, because I would like to be taller, but I' m not.
It really gets down to this idea of correlation and causation.
Lots and lots of interesting work with real applications.
Like if I have a product that I want to spread through a network
or if I want people to change their behavior and stop smoking,
is it influence or is it selection?
Because depending on which one it is, I should do either viral marketing or targeted outreach.
So, it 's very important.

Let 's take a look at the answer about which intellectual property matched
what is protectable in examples.
For trademark, what is protectable is branding.
Examples are marks and logos and slogans.
For copyright, it 's creative, authored works and expressions. Not ideas.
The examples could be software, songs, movies, website content.
For trade secrets, what 's protectable is anything. Secrets that you think have economic value.
Examples are non - public technology like the Coke secret recipe,
or your proprietary customer list, or some kind of algorithm or formula
you didn 't want to patent.
For contract and non - disclosure agreements, what is protectable is whatever you
and the person who is going to do the deal with you have defined in the contract
and is enforceable in the law.
You could have technology, business information, etc. as examples.
Finally patents. So what 's protectable are non - obvious inventions.
Examples are new technology that haven 't been previously patented or applied for,
and you have to be first.

Paulo wants to earn $1500 by mowing lawns.
He will charge $35 for each lawn he mows.
What is the minimum number of lawns the Paulo needs to mow
to reach his goal of $1500?
So we need to figure out the minimum number of lawns that
Paulo needs to mow.
Now, whatever that number is, that number times $35, because
that 's how much he' s going to get per lawn.
So the number that he has to mow times $35 needs to be
So to figure out that number, let 's just divide 1, 500
Maybe it goes evenly, and that 'll be the number of lawn
that 's how much he gets paid per lawn.
35 does not go into 15.
Let 's try out 4.
Let 's see if it goes into it four times.
4 times 5 is 20.
Let 's regroup the 2, or carry the 2.
Four times 3 is 12.
12 plus 2 is 14.
Now we subtract.
0 minus 0 is 0.
5 minus 4 is 1.
The ones cancel out, and then we bring down
this zero right here.
35 goes into 100.
Well, 35 times 2 is 70, and if you add another - - 35 times 3
is 105, so that 's too big, so it goes into it two times.
2 times 5 is 10.
Let 's carry the 1.
2 times 3 is 6 plus 1 is 7, or 35 times 2 is 70.
You subtract.
0 minus 0 is 0.
0 minus 7, you can 't do it.
You could already view it as 10 minus 7, or if you want to
go in the traditional way, this 0 can take or borrow 1
from this 1, so that becomes a 0.
This becomes a 10.
10 minus 7 is 30.
And so there 's nothing left to bring down.
so we now know that 35 goes into 1, 500 forty - two times,
but there 's a remainder of 30.
If he mowed 42 lawns, he 'd be 30 short of 1, 500.
35 times 42 is 30 less than 1, 500.
What would it be?
1, 470.
So in order to make 1, 500, he 's going to have to go over
it, so he 's going to have to do one more lawn than this.
So just to remind ourselves, if we just divide - - let me
1, 500 divided by 35 is equal to 42, remainder 30, so 42
won 't be enough lawns.
We 're going to have more to - - we have 30 more bucks to earn,
so he 's going to have to mow one more lawn to get another
$35, so he 's going to have $5 left over after he
makes up this 30.
So he 's going to have to mow 43 lawns if he really wants to
cross this threshold of $1500.
If he does mow the 43 lawns, he 'll have more than $1500.

Let me just remind you the reason why I love
this lecture is that there is a series of common
mistakes that first time an even experienced
entrepreneurs make in thinking about revenue
and pricing. And the first one is that this whole
idea about revenue stream, Steve, I get it. You
know, revenue stream. It’s about the price, the
dollar amount I am charring customers.
That’s a mistake.
And you will see later that pricing is a tactic.
Or maybe I kind of get it, okay, now I understand
that pricing is a tactic, but I’ll set the price
of a product based on how much it costs me
to make it. Well, how else would you set pricing.
It cost me 99 cents to make it. I’ll charge
a $1. 25 and, you know, that’s kind of a reasonable
price. We’ll also see why that might be a huge
mistake and leaving lots of money on the table.
And then kind of the third common errors, my
price hast to be less than my competitor’s
price. If they’re charging $5, 000, the best way
to enter a market is to charge $4000. Why
– no one would pay any more than the existing
incumbents. And we’re going to see that’s
another going out of business strategy. And
all this depends on your knowledge that you’ve
just learned about the customers, their reaction
to the value proposition and all the work you’ve
been doing outside the building. You’re
going to have an incredible advantage
in thinking about revenue and pricing.

Where the product goes and see the box labeled value proposition.
As was simulated, the value proposition includes all the features of your product
but also the pains and gains you 're solving for the customer segment
and that 's where the market goes.
The market includes where your customers are and what problems you 're solving for them.

Next piece is you want to think about is what in the key resources?
What do you need to make the business model work? What assets are important?
And what 's an example of an asset in a key resource, well finance.
Do you need capital? Do you need a line of credit?
Some assets are in resources or physical. Do you need physical plant like a manufacturing line?
Do you need specialized machines? Do you need vans for delivery? Do you need cars?
Is there 's something else you need? Is there intellectual property you need?
Is there patents you need to acquire or protect? Do you need to acquire customer list?
Or is it just that you need to get great people, great shop or programmers in the specific area
or great hardware designers or great manufacturing people.
And then finally again at the interaction between intellectual and human capital is that 's
another key resource. What specifically do you need to do to keep this people and who are they.

The next piece is who are your key partners and suppliers.
Partnerships are kind of interesting is we need to ask ourselves before what 's the deal
is what exactly are we acquiring from partners, and also
what activities are they going to perform and when.
And this is where a start up sometimes make a mistake of thinking while large companies
do partnerships, I guess I need those two on day 1.
Change all the types of partnerships you need in year 1 are certainly not the ones
you 're going to need in year 3 or 5 or 10, and the types of partnerships could be strategic alliances,
joint ventures, just regular suppliers and buyers, and you need to be thinking through
who they are and after your getting out of the building and tested them.

The interesting thing about the customer development process
ties back into agile engineering and agile development hand and glove.
Basically it 's this notion of the minimum viable product.
Back in the old days what we used to do is specify
the entire feature set of the product
from beginning to end.
Now, this makes sense when you 're in a large company
releasing version 2. 0, 3. 0 and 4. 0
because you kind of have a feeling of who the customers are and what they need,
so a product manager can be pretty accurate about
I 've been interacting with customers for the last year and a half,
and I think I know what they need.
But in a startup you 're really kind of guessing,
and the odds are you 're going to be guessing wrong,
so rather than waste a whole ton of time and money
why don 't we actually get outside the building before we build something
and waste a lot of engineering time, and more importantly,
cash, because that 's what puts startups out of business is running out of money.
We want to make sure that we actually listen to the people
who eventually will buy this product.
We want to make sure we satisfy their wants and needs.
Why don 't we just figure out how to build the minimum viable product?
Build the minimum features in order to get feedback.
Now, feedback could take the form of input verbally,
or they gave you early orders, or they gave you anything that was valuable
in helping you come to closure on what should we be building in what order?
And by the way, an MVP could be something as simple on the Web
as a wireframe or a PowerPoint slide,
or for physical products it could be a physical mockup,
or it could be a working part of the system.
But as you get more feedback you could start adding more features.
One caveat is a comment I always get is
"Steve Jobs didn 't build the iPhone by asking customers."
And we really doubt Henry Ford asked customers
do they want a car before one existed.
In fact, in his case if you would have asked people about what they wanted
they would have said a faster horse or one with 6 legs.
And so the immediate response is "Well, therefore for new products
you just don 't get out of the building at all, "and that' s just a fallacy.
There is a type of startup in what we call a new market,
and we 'll be describing new markets in the Customer Segments lecture.
But just understand that in new markets of course you don 't get out
and ask people what features they need.
But you do want to understand how is their day in a life
different today versus the day after you give them your new product?
How does their world change?
And there 's no possible way sitting locked in your conference room
or your office you would know that without talking to customers.

Carving candles is an old German craft still practiced by artisans.
It involves layering different colored wax
Then carving designs to expose those luminous colors.
It is hard to beat the radiant beauty of a carved candle.
Carved candles are known for their swirls and curls.
A look so elaborate that lighting one is an occasion in itself.
The process starts with pots of hot wax in various colors.
The candle maker stirs them to circulate the specially formulated dyes.
She dips the star shaped wax core into clear wax and then yellow.
The clear wax dilutes whatever color wax follows it.
The layers are hardened in cool water.
She repeats this process between thirty and thirty - five times
building different colored layers on the candle core.
As the dipping continues, the candle becomes warmer and softer
which will allow it to be carved.
The quick water dips only cool the outer layers.
Part way into the dipping, the candle maker deepens the candle 's grooves.
As she resumes dipping, she has to keep a close watch on candle 's temperature.
If it absorbs too much heat, it will be too soft to carve.
But if its too cool, the wax can splinter.
Achieving the right consistency is crucial.
Its almost time to get carving, but first the candle maker squeezes the drippings together
and slices them off. They are too attractive to waste, so she quickly shapes them into a mushroom candle.
She pokes a hole in the center of the candle for the wick
and within moments the candle is complete.
With the big candle at the perfect temperature, the clock is ticking.
It has to be carved in just 15 minutes or it will be too hard to work with.
The candle maker slices the bottom and curls the pieces back.
She dunks the row of curls into water to harden them a bit so they don 't sag.
On the second row, she curls each row in the opposite direction of the one before.
She carves a total of four rows with the last curls fixed upright.
Using a square edged gauging tool, she cuts a windmill design into the upper section of the candle.
Then she shapes the wax cut out into a base for the windmill.
Tulips and other designs decorate the top of the candle.
She must work with a quick, but a steady hand. It takes at least a year of training to learn
to carve with such confidence. This one is a neat trick.
She jiggles the strap leaded knife to cut the fluted edge of a hummingbird wing.
One last character and this carving job is complete.
Now she presses a cookie cutter like device around the wick.
This forms a well that will allow the wax to burn down the center instead of dripping
down the sides which would ruin the carving.
She spins the candle in a hot pan to melt the bottom, so that its level
and while its still hot she attaches the company sticker.
Finally, an acrylic glaze seals the candle 's decorations and protects the finish.
Once lit, the light from the clear core shines through the design for a real glowing beauty.

This question is optional, but now that we know some more about
searching a graph, testing for connectedness,
and finding bridge edges, you might be able to improve
your Eulerian Tour finding routine from the first unit.
If you go back to the challenge problem in unit 1 and add the line
use < u > harder < / u > tests = True to your code
the grader will use more complicated graphs.

Rewrite the expression five times 9 minus 4 - - that 's in
parentheses - - using the distributive law of
Then simplify.
So let me just rewrite it.
This is going to be 5 times 9 minus 4, just like that.
Now, if we want to use the distributive property, well,
you don 't have to.
You could just evaluate 9 minus 4 and then
multiply that times 5.
But if you want to use the distributive property, you
distribute the 5.
You multiply the 5 times the 9 and the 4, so you end up with
5 times 9 minus 5 times 4.

Notice, we distributed the 5.
We multiplied it times both the 9 and the 4.
In the first distributive property video, we gave you an
idea of why you have to distribute the 5, why it makes
sense, why you don 't just multiply it by the 9.
And we 're going to verify that it gives us the same answer as
if we just evaluated the 9 minus 4 first. But anyway,
what are these things?
So 5 times 9, that is 45.
So we have 45 minus - - what 's 5 times 4?
Well, that 's 20.
45 minus 20, and that is equal to 25, so this is using the
distributive property right here.
If we didn 't want to use the distributive property, if we
just wanted to evaluate what 's in the parentheses first, we
would have gotten - - let 's go in this direction - - 5 times - -
what 's 9 minus 4?

9 minus 4 is 5.
Let me do that in a different color.
5 times 9 minus 4.
So it 's 5 times 5.
5 times 5 is just 25, so we get the same
answer either way.
This is using the distributive law of multiplication over
subtraction, usually just referred to as the
distributive property.
This is evaluating the inside of the parentheses first and
then multiplying by 5.


Let 's just take a look at the last piece which is why you' re here.
How do we teach entrepreneurship?
Well, in the past, entrepreneurial education was about execution.
We 're going to teach you how to write a business plan.
We 're going to teach you how to put together the power point for the VC presentation.
If we 're doing it really well, we' ll have you lots of research.
But it really assumed it was all about execution. What we now know that 's just simply not the case.
Entrepreneurial education, the reason why you 're taking this class
is about the search for the business model and we 're going to teach you how to search.
And so what that means about entrepreneurial education is that eventually
we do need you to know everything an MBA knows.
Eventually if your success in growing your startup into a large company,
you 're going to need to know about accounting and HR
and organizational behavior and global leadership and etc.
But at first, you need a different set of skills that just never existed before,
and so welcome to the first class of its type that 's going to put search first and that' s a radical change.
It 's not just one more methodology.
This class is going to teach you all the skills about strategy and process and organization
and eventually if you build a successful company, we 'll then allow you to write the plans
and operating documents and financial spreadsheets to actually execute the company.
Hold on to your seats, we 're about to get started and let' s jump in
to business models and customer development.

Well, if you look at the Amazon website and now that you can go AWS
but just a traditional bookselling website, you 'll find that all of these things are part of their product.
The website for allowing users to find and buy products,
a review system and rating system for products,
protection against fraud for marketplace sellers,
and the content itself - - movies, books, music, etc.
The sum of all these are what makes up Amazon 's complete product.

In the last video we went over the multiplication tables for one through nine
and I ran out of time, and actually, it was a good thing
because one through nine are kind of the core multiplication tables.
And you 'll see that if you know all your multiplication tables from one to nine,
so you know any number between one and nine
times any other number between one and nine,
you can actually do any multiplication problem out there.
But what I want to do now
is I want to complete the multiplication tables for ten, eleven, and twelve.
So what is ten times - - let 's just start with zero.
Ten times zero.
Anything times zero is zero.
Ten zeros are zero.
Zero plus zero plus zero ten times is still zero.
What 's ten times one?
Ten times one.
Well that 's just ten one time.
Or one plus itself ten times.
That 's ten.
I think this is second nature to you at this point.
What 's ten times two?
Ten times two.
I meant to switch colors, but I didn 't.
Ten times two?
That 's ten plus ten, which is twenty.
Fair enough.
And notice, we went up by ten the first time.
We went up by ten again to get to twenty.
What 's ten times three?
Well, that 's ten plus ten plus ten,
or we could view it as ten times two plus another ten,
which is equal to thirty.
What 's ten times four?
I think you start to see a pattern.
Ten times four is equal to forty.
Notice, ten times four is equal to forty.
If I were to ask you what is ten times - -
let me do another color - - five?
Well that 's equal to fifty.
Ten times anything is that anything with a zero behind it.
So the ten times tables,
you almost don 't have to remember it.
So let 's just keep going.
What 's ten times six?
It 's equal to sixty.
Six zero.
What 's ten times seven?
Seventy.
Ten times eight?
This is almost ridiculous.
Ten times eight is eighty.
Ten times nine?
Ninety.
Ten times ten?
Now this is interesting.
Ten times ten, so it 'll be a ten - -
let 's see me write this.
Let me do it in this orange color.
Ten times ten.
So it 'll be ten tens or a ten with a zero behind it.
There you go. Notice, whatever number times ten, I just add a zero,
then I get the next number.
So it 's one hundred.
And I think you understand why that is.
I added ten to itself ten times.
That each ten - - you go from ten, twenty, thirty.
Thirty is just three tens or ten times three.
Ninety is just nine tens or nine times ten.
Let 's keep going.
So ten times eleven is equal to eleven with a zero behind it.
One hundred and ten.
Finally, ten times twelve is equal to one hundred and twenty.
Now, just for fun, these are kind of your ten times tables.
But now that you know the pattern you can do anything.
If I asked you what five thousand seven hundred thirty - two times ten is,
what 's it going to be?
It 's going to be this number with just one more zero.
So it 's going to be - - I won' t read it out yet.
Five seven three two with a zero behind it.
And just so you know,
this little comma that I wrote in the number there,
that 's just to make it easier for me to read that number.
So, you put the comma - - you start over here
and every third number you put the comma.
So here I 'm going to put the comma right here.
I 'm going to put the comma right there.
So now I can read this.
The comma doesn 't really add or take anything away from the number,
it just helps me read it.
Now five thousand seven hundred thirty - two times ten is fifty - seven thousand three hundred twenty.
I just had to add a zero there,
but that was a pretty straightforward multiplication.
And notice, we had five thousand times ten
and we got to fifty - something thousand when we multiplied them.
So that 's similar to five times ten is equal to fifty.
But instead of five I had a five thousand,
and so I got a fifty thousand and something and all this other stuff.
We 're going to learn more about how to do problems like this in the future.
But I thought I would introduce you to the idea
that just from this little pattern of adding a zero,
you already know your tens times tables.
Now let 's do our elevens.
Our elevens, Elevens get a little bit - -
Well, they start off easy,
and then they get a little more difficult as we get into high numbers.
So, eleven times zero.
This is easy, this is zero!
Eleven times one.
This is also easy!
It 's eleven!
Eleven times two.
We 're going to start seeing a pattern here.
It 's eleven plus eleven or we could' ve added two to itself eleven times,
but that is equal to twenty - two.
If we do eleven times three, it is equal to thirty - three.
Eleven times four is equal to forty - four.
I think this is becoming obvious to you.
What 's eleven times five?
Eleven times five is fifty - five!
Notice I put the five twice.
What 's eleven times six?
It 's sixty - six!
Eleven times seven is eighty - four - - no!
I 'm kidding!
I didn 't want to mess with you like that.
But no.
Of course, it 's seventy - seven!
Seventy - seven.
You just repeat the number twice.
Seventy - seven.
Let me switch colors.
Eleven times eight is equal to eighty - eight.
Eleven times nine is equal to ninety - nine!
Now what 's eleven times twelve?
Eleven times twelve.
Oh sorry, I skipped ten.
Eleven times ten.
You might want to say it 's "tenty - ten!"
No!
That 's wrong!
It 's not "tenty - ten!"
So that little pattern that we had
where you just repeat the number,
that only works for one digit numbers.
So it only works for one through nine.
Eleven times ten - -
well, we could think about it a couple of ways.
We can add eleven to ninety - nine.
So we can say it 's ninety - nine plus eleven.
And what 's that?
That 's equal to one hundred and ten.
And I 'm going to show you how to do - -
well, hopefully you 've already watched the video on how to add two - digit numbers like this,
but that 's one hundred and ten.
Or you could just use the property from the tens times tables that we learned.
Where if you just take eleven times ten, you add a zero to the eleven,
you get one hundred ten.
That 's the eleven right there.
Finally, let 's do eleven times twelve.
Eleven times twelve.
No easy way to remember this,
you just kind of should remember it.
Or you could say look,
it 's going to be eleven more than eleven times - - sorry.
I keep skipping things.
We should do eleven times eleven first.
Let me make sure this is clear.
We 're doing eleven times eleven before we go to eleven times twelve.
So eleven times eleven is going to be eleven more than eleven times ten.
So we add eleven to this.
Eleven plus one hundred ten is one hundred twenty - one.
And actually, as you 'll see,
there actually is an order as we get to higher multiples of eleven,
but I 'll leave that to a future video.
And then finally, we 're at eleven times twelve.
Eleven times twelve.
And we could add eleven to itself twelve times.
We could add twelve to itself eleven times.
Or we could just say,
hey, it 's going to be eleven more than eleven times eleven.
So that is what?
You add eleven to this.
What do you get?
You get one hundred thirty - two.
I just added one hundred twenty - one plus eleven
and then got one hundred thirty - two.
Now the other way you could have said it is, well,
what 's ten times twelve?
Ten times twelve,
we already knew that.
That was one hundred twenty.
So eleven times twelve,
because we 're multiplying twelve by one more
should be twelve more than that.
So that should be one hundred thirty - two.
So two ways to get the exact same answer.
All right! Now let 's do our twelve times tables.
Twelve times tables.
And once you know this
you are ready to tackle any type of multiplication problem.
But we 'll do that in future videos.
So twelve times zero.
Super easy! Zero.
Twelve times one.
Also super easy!
Is twelve.
Now it gets interesting.
We 're going to increase by twelve every time.
Twelve times two is equal to twenty - four.
Twelve plus twelve is twenty - four, right?
Twelve times - - not twenty - two.
Let me rewrite that.
Twelve times three is going to be twelve plus twelve plus twelve.
Or we could write that as twelve times two.
I see my brain is doing the wrong things.
We could rewrite that as twelve times two plus twelve.
Or we could rewrite that as twenty - four plus twelve.
Either way, all of these get us to thirty - six.
And notice, that 's just that plus twelve.
Twelve times four.
Twelve times four is equal to forty - eight.
There 's a lot of ways you could think about it.
You could say eleven times four is forty - four.
Right? Eleven times four is equal to forty - four.
And you go up by one more four, so you get to twelve times four.
Or you could say twelve times three is thirty - six
and you can add one twelve to it to get to forty - eight.
Either way works,
and that 's because you can multiply in either direction.
Let 's keep going.
Twelve times five is equal to sixty.
Ten times five is fifty, eleven times five is fifty - five,
so twelve times five is sixty!
Twelve times six is equal to what?
It 's going to be twelve more than this.
It 's going to be equal to seventy - two.
Twelve times seven.
Twelve more than this again.
Twelve more than seventy - two is eighty - four.
And I 'm serious, you know, I' m probably a lot older than you are,
and I still, in my head to confirm,
I go to some twelve times tables that I remember as definitely right.
Like oh, twelve times five - - and sometimes in my head I say,
oh, let me add another twelve.
Oh yeah, definitely, my memory was correct.
Twelve times six is seventy - two.
All right.
Then you go to twelve times eight.
Add twelve to the twelve times seven.
Ninety - six.
Twelve times nine.
Well you add twelve to this, so it 's one hundred eight.
One hundred eight.
And then twelve times ten.
This is an easy one!
Right? We just add a zero to the twelve to get one hundred twenty.
Or we could 've added twelve to one hundred eight.
Either way.
Twelve times eleven.
We just did this.
You add twelve to this to get one hundred thirty - two.
And then twelve times twelve,
is equal to one hundred forty - four.
And this actually shows us - -
If I had a dozen of a dozen eggs - - a dozen is twelve.
Or if I had a - - I think a gross is actually twelve dozens.
So that 's one hundred forty - four eggs.
So you 'll actually end up seeing this number a lot.
More than you would expect in life.
But anyway, we 've now completed all of our multiplication tables.
And I really encourage you to take the time now to go and memorize them.
Make some flash cards.
Use the little software thing that I wrote on my website.
You could try that out.
As of September Two Thousand Nine, it 's working.
I haven 't touched it in a while, but I' m actually probably going to rebuild it soon.
So if you 're watching this video in the year Two Thousand Two Hundred - -
Well, I would probably not exist anymore.
But hopefully you 'll get a better version of the software app.
But you should practice it.
You should get your parents to quiz you.
You should get notes cards.
You should just be mumbling to yourself as you walk to school - -
What is twelve times nine?
What is eleven times eleven?
And you should quiz each other,
because it 'll pay huge rewards to you later on in life.
See you in the next video!

Use the commutative law of multiplication to write 2
times 34 in a different way.
Simplify both expressions to show that they
have identical results.
So once again, this commutative law just means
that order doesn 't matter.
It sounds very fancy.
Commutative law of multiplication.
But all that says is that it doesn 't matter whether we do 2
times 34 or whether we do 34 times 2.
The order does not matter.
We can commute the two terms. Both of these are going to get
you the same exact answer.
So let 's try it out.
What is 2 times 34?
And we could write it like this, literally.
You 'll almost never see it written like this, but it is
literally 2 times 34.
Almost always people write the larger digit on top, or the
digit with more digits, or the number with
more digits on top.
But let 's do it this way.
4 times 2 is 8, and then we 'll put a 0.
3 times 2 is 6, or you can view it as 30 times 2 is 60.
Add them together.
8 plus 0 is 8.
6, bring it down.
It 's not being added to anything.
You get 68.
So 2 times 34 is 68.
Now, if you do 34 times 2, 2 times 4 is 8, 2 times 3 is 6.
That 's why it' s always nicer to write the number with more
digits on top.
It also is equal to 68.
So it doesn 't matter whether you have two groups of 34 or
thirty - four groups of 2, in either case, you 're
going to have 68.

One of the things I just want to reemphasize because we mentioned it earlier
is the difference between single - sided markets and multi - sided markets.
Now, in single - sided markets the customer is the user and the payer.
That 's a single - sided market. There are no separate users, and there are no separate payers.
You 're it. Congratulations. You' re the customer and you 're going to pay for it.
But in multi - sided markets there might be users,
but they 're also might be very separate people who are payers.
The example we keep using is Google,
because everybody around the world has probably had at one time or another
been a Google user.
When you use the Google search bar you 're one side of a multi - sided market.
You 're the user, but you' re not the payer. You 're not paying for the product.
But in reality, you 're paying implicitly,
because there is another side.
The other side are the people using Google Adwords
to look for keywords.
In multi - sided markets the company, your startup,
typically cares about acquiring a massive amount of users
and then figuring out how to monetize those users next.
Google decided to go from millions and then tens of millions of users,
and then the keywords came after.
Now, depending on your investors, this might be their strategy.
I tend to prefer that we actually try to look for who the payers are as early as possible,
but this is a question you might want to ask your investors.
Do we go for lots of users and then say if we get 10 million people
the revenues will come?
Or do we want to look at both sides of the market at the same time?
Again, if you 're in a physical channel,
my suggestion is you want to take a look at users and payers simultaneously.
If you say your business is advertising - based,
some of the tactics are how do you get to 10 million monthly users?
How do you become one of the top five websites?
And how much do the payers actually pay?
Now, if you wait 2 years to find this out,
you might have gotten 10 million of the wrong users.
Your job is not only to talk to the users in a multi - sided market.
You 're job is to get out of the building and talk to the payers.
Because you have a hypothesis, an important one,
which is how much will those payers pay for the users you think you 're collecting.
Guess what?
If you 're wrong, the time to know about it is now, not two years from now,
and it 's okay to be wrong,
because most startups all you have is a series of hypotheses,
and it 's really easy to get caught up in the passion that says,
well, if we get all these people obviously these people will pay us lots of money.
But as soon as we get out of the building that obviously might turn into maybe not.
What we want to do is get the facts as quickly as we can
and then iterate and pivot.
So, don 't worry if your assumptions were wrong here on your revenue model.
You just want to find it out before you start burning a lot of cash
and building a lot of value prop around the wrong model.

What I 'm going to attempt to do in the next two videos is really just give an overview
of everything that 's happened to Earth since it came into existence.
We 're going start really at the formation of Earth or the formation of our Solar system or the formation of
the Sun, and our best sense of what actually happened is that
there was a supernova in our vicinity of the galaxy,
and this right here is a picture of a supernova remnant,
actually, the remnant for Kepler 's supernova.
The supernova in this picture actually happened four hundred years ago in 1604,
so right at the center a star essentially exploded
and for a few weeks was the brightest object in the night sky,
and it was observed by Kepler and other people in 1604,
and this is what it looks like now.
What we see is kinda the shockwave that 's been traveling
out for the past 400 years, so now it must be many
light years across. It wasn 't, obviously, matter wasn' t
traveling at the speed of light, but it must 've been traveling
pretty, pretty fast, at least relativistic speeds, a reasonable
fraction of the speed of light.
This has traveled a good bit out now, but what you can
imagine is when you have the shockwave traveling out from
a supernova, let 's say you had a cloud of molecules,
a cloud of gas, that before the shockwave came by just
wasn 't dense enough for gravity to take over,
and for it to accrete, essentially, into a solar system.
When the shockwave passes by it compresses all of this gas
and all of this material and all of these molecules, so
it now does have that critical density to form, to accrete
into a star and a solar system.
We think that 's what' s happened, and the reason why we
feel pretty strongly that it must 've been caused by a supernova
is that the only way that the really heavy elements can form,
or the only way we know that they can form is in kind of
the heat of a supernova, and our uranium, the uranium that seems
to be in our solar system on Earth, seems to have formed
roughly at the time of the formation of Earth, at about
four and a half billion years ago, and we 'll talk
in a little bit more depth in future videos on exactly how
people figure that out, but since the uranium seems about
the same age as our solar system, it must 've been formed
at around the same time, and it must 've been formed by a supernova,
and it must be coming from a supernova, so a supernova
shockwave must 've passed through our part of the universe,
and that 's a good reason for gas to get compressed and begin to accrete.
So you fast - forward a few million years.
That gas would 've accreted into something like this.
It would 've reached the critical temperature, critical density
and pressure at the center for ignition to occur, for fusion
to start to happen, for hydrogen to start fusing into helium,
and this right here is our early sun.
Around the sun you have all of the gases and particles
and molecules that had enough angular velocity to not fall into the sun,
to go into orbit around the sun.
They were actually supported by a little bit of pressure, too,
because you can kinda view this as kind of a big cloud of gas,
so they 're always bumping into each other, but for the most part
it was their angular velocity, and over the next tens of millions of years
they 'll slowly bump into each other and clump into each other.
Even small particles have gravity, and they 're gonna slowly
become rocks and asteroids and, eventually, what we would call
"planetesimals," which are, kinda view them as seeds
of planets or early planets, and then those would have a reasonable amount
of gravity and other things would be attracted to them
and slowly clump up to them.
This wasn 't like a simple process, you know, you could imagine
you might have one planetesimal form, and then there 's another
planetesimal formed, and instead of having a nice, gentle
those two guys accreting into each other, they might have
huge relative velocities and ram into each other, and then just,
you know, shatter, so this wasn 't just a nice, gentle process of constant accretion.
It would actually have been a very violent process,
actually happened early in Earth 's history, and we actually think
this is why the Moon formed, so at some point
you fast - forward a little bit from this, Earth would have formed,
I should say, the mass that eventually becomes our modern Earth
would have been forming. Let me draw it over here.
So, let 's say that that is our modern Earth, and what we think
happened is that another proto - planet or another,
it was actually a planet because it was roughly the size of Mars,
ran into our, what it is eventually going to become our Earth.
This is actually a picture of it.
This is an artist 's depiction of that collision, where this planet
right here is the size of Mars, and it ran into what would eventually become Earth.
This we call Theia. This is Theia,
and what we believe happened, and if you look up,
if you go onto the Internet, you 'll see some simulations
that talk about this, is that we think it was a glancing blow.
It wasn 't a direct hit that would' ve just kinda shattered
each of them and turned into one big molten ball.
We think it was a glancing blow, something like this.
This was essentially Earth. Obviously, Earth got changed
dramatically once Theia ran into it, but Theia is
right over here, and we think it was a glancing blow.
It came and it hit Earth at kind of an angle, and then it
obviously the combined energies from that interaction
would 've made both of them molten, and frankly
they probably already were molten because you had
a bunch of smaller collisions and accretion events and
little things hitting the surface, so probably both of them
during this entire period, but this would 've had a
glancing blow on Earth and essentially splashed a bunch
of molten material out into orbit.
It would 've just come in, had a glancing blow on Earth,
and then splashed a bunch of molten material,
some of it would 've been captured by Earth, so this is
the before and the after, you can imagine, Earth is
kind of this molten, super hot ball, and some of it
just gets splashed into orbit from the collision.
Let me just see if I can draw Theia here, so
Theia has collided, and it is also molten now because
huge energies, and it splashes some of it into orbit.
If we fast - forward a little bit, this stuff that got splashed
into orbit, it 's going in that direction, that becomes
our Moon, and then the rest of this material eventually
kind of condenses back into a spherical shape and is what
we now call our Earth.
So that 's how we actually think right now that the Moon
actually formed.
Even after this happened, the Earth still had a lot more,
I guess, violence to experience.
Just to get a sense of where we are in the history of Earth,
we 're going to refer to this time clock a lot over the next few videos,
this time clock starts right here at the formation of our solar system,
4. 6 billion years ago, probably coinciding with
some type of supernova,
and as we go clockwise on this diagram,
we 're moving forward in time, and we' re gonna go
all the way forward to the present period,
and just so you understand some of the terminology,
"Ga" means "billions of years ago"
'G' for "Giga -"
"Ma" means "millions of years ago"
'M' for "Mega -"
So where we are right now, the Moon has formed,
and we 're in what we call the Hadean period
or actually I shouldn 't say "period."
It 's the Hadean eon of Earth.
"Period" is actually another time period,
so let me make this very clear. It 's the Hadean,
we are in the Hadean eon, and an eon is kind of
the largest period of time that we talk about, especially
relative to Earth, and it 's roughly 500 million to a billion years
is an eon, and what makes the Hadean eon distinctive,
well, from a geological point of view what makes it
distinctive is really we don 't have any rocks from the
Hadean period. We don 't have any kind of macroscopic - scale
rocks from the Hadean period, and that 's because
at that time, we believe, the Earth was just this molten
ball of kind of magma and lava, and it was molten
because it was a product of all of these accretion events
and all of these collisions and all this kinetic energy turning into heat.
If you were to look at the surface of the Earth,
if you were to be on the surface of the Earth during
the Hadean eon, which you probably wouldn 't want to be
because you might get hit by a falling meteorite
or probably burned by some magma, whatever,
it would look like this, and you wouldn 't be able to breathe anyway;
this is what the surface of the Earth would look like.
It would look like a big magma pool, and that 's why we
don 't have any rocks from there because the rocks were
just constantly being recycled, being dissolved and churned
inside of this giant molten ball, and frankly
the Earth still is a giant molten ball, it 's just
we live on the super - thin, cooled crust of that molten ball.
If you go right below that crust, and we 'll talk a little bit more
about that in future videos,
you will get magma, and if you go dig deeper,
you 'll have liquid iron.
I mean, it still is a molten ball.
And this whole period is just a violent,
not only was Earth itself a volcanic, molten ball,
it began to harden as you get into the late Hadean eon,
but we also had stuff falling from the sky and constantly
colliding with Earth, and really just continuing to add
to the heat of this molten ball.
Anyway, I 'll leave you there,
and, as you can imagine,
at this point there was no, as far as we can tell,
there was no life on Earth.
Some people believe that maybe some life could 've formed
in the late Hadean eon, but for the most part
this was just completely inhospitable for any life forming.
I 'll leave you there, and where we take up the next video,
we 'll talk a little bit about the Archean eon.

Looking at the Amazon website for books, which of the following are part of Amazon 's products,
and tick all that apply

Here is the code for up heapify, right now it is blank.
Here we have a hip. Now suppose that we insert a
new element. For example, with value nine, this is
the current node. Since we insert in a new element,
the hip propriety may be belated. So to fix that, we
have to ask is the value of this node smaller than the
value of its parent. That’s the case. The property is
belated. So how do we fix that? We just interchange
the values, this becomes nine and this becomes
fourteen. To do this in Python code, we just write this
line to check the value of the current node is smaller
than the value of its parent, that’s true. We just
interchange the values like we did here. Since we
modified the value of this node, the hip property may
be now belated between this node and its parent. So
we set the current node to be this one and we can
do that in Python code like this. Now we again check,
is the value of this node is smaller than the value of
its parent, yes. So we just interchange those values.
Since we have already written code for doing that,
we just need to repeat the same process until this
condition is false or until we reach the red node.

What I want to do in this video is talk a little bit
about the kidney - - and this is a big picture of a kidney - -
and to talk about how it operates at its - - I guess you
could call it its smallest functional level and that 's
the nephron.
So we 're going to talk about the kidney and the nephron.
And I think you might already know the kidney.
We have two of them.
They 're the organ that, I guess, is most famous for
producing or allowing us to excrete waste.
But part of that process, it also helps us maintain our
water, the correct level, and actually the amount of salts
or electrolytes we have and our blood pressure, but I 'll
just say maintain water.
And it also produces hormones and things, and I 'm not going
to go into a lot of detail on that right now.
I really just want to focus on these first two to kind of
just understand the overview function of the kidney.
And most of us have two of these.
They 're kind of closer to our back on either sides of our
spine behind our liver.
And this is a zoomed - in version of it.
If you 're watching this in full screen, it' s not going to
be as big as this picture is, but we 've sliced it so we can
see what 's going on inside the kidney.
Just to understand the different parts here, just
because it will actually be significant when we start
talking about the functional units or the nephron within
the kidney, this area right here from here to here, this
is called the renal cortex.
Whenever we talk about something with the kidney, if
you see a renal anything, that 's actually referring to
the kidney.
So this right here is a renal cortex, that
outer part right there.
And then this area right here, this is the renal medulla.
And medulla comes from middle.
So you can almost view it as the middle of the kidney.
It really winds around like that.
This is called the glomerulus.
Efferent just means away from the center.
Afferent towards, efferent away from the center.
And I 'll talk about it more in the future, but it' s
interesting that we 're still dealing with an
artery at this point.
It 's still oxygenated blood.
Normally, when we leave a capillary system like the
glomerulus right there, we 're normally dealing with the
venous system, but here we 're still an arterial system.
And it 's probably because arterial systems have higher
blood pressure, and what we need to do is we need to
squeeze fluid and stuff that 's dissolved in the fluid out of
the blood and in the glomerulus right here.
So this glomerulus is very porous and it 's surrounded by
other cells.
This is kind of a cross - section.
cells here so you can imagine these are all cells over here.
And, of course, the actual capillaries have cells that
line them so there are cells here.
So when I draw these lines, these lines are actually made
up of little cells.
What happens is the blood comes in
at really high pressure.
This is very porous.
These cells out here, they 're called podocytes.
They 're a little bit more selective in what gets
filtered out, and essentially about a fifth of the fluid
that 's coming in ends up going into this space right here
that 's called the Bowman' s space.
Well, actually, this whole thing is called
the Bowman 's capsule.
kind of wind around in, and the space right here, this is
the Bowman 's space.
It 's the space inside the Bowman' s capsule, and the
whole thing has cells.
All these structures are obviously made - - or maybe not
so obviously - - they 're made up of cells.
And so we end up having filtrate in it.
Filtrate is just the stuff that gets squeezed out.
We can 't call it urine just yet because there' s a lot of
steps that have to occur for it to earn the name urine.
So it 's only filtrate right now, and essentially what get
squeezed out, I said it 's about a fifth of the fluid,
and things that are easily dissolved in fluid, so small
ions, sodium, maybe some small molecules like glucose, maybe
some amino acids.
There are tons of stuff in here, but this is
just to give an idea.
The things that do not get filtered are things like red
blood cells or larger molecules, larger proteins.
They will not get filtered.
It 's mainly the micromolecules that' ll get filtered, that 'll
be part of this filtrate that shows up here
in the Bowman space.
Now, the rest of what the nephron does, the Bowman 's
capsule is kind of the beginning of the nephron, and
just to get an idea of our big picture of our kidney, let 's
say we 're near an arterial.
This is a Bowman 's capsule right here.
It looks something like that, and the whole nephron is going
to be convoluted like this.
It 's going to dip down into the medulla, and then come
back, and then it 's going to eventually dump into a
collecting duct, and I 'll talk more about that.
So what I 've drawn just here, this is a zoomed - in version of
that part right there.
Now what I want to do is zoom out a little bit because I 'm
going to run out of space.
So let me zoom out.
So we had our arterial go in.
It gets all bunched in the glomerulus, and then most of
the blood leaves, but one - fifth of it gets
essentially filtered in to the Bowman 's capsule.
That 's the Bowman' s capsule right there.
I 've just zoomed out a little bit.
So we have our filtrate here.
Maybe I 'll make it a little bit yellow.
it 's called the glomerular filtrate because it' s been
filtered by the glomerulus, but it 's also been filtered by
those podocyte cells on the inside of
the Bowman 's capsule.
Let me draw something like this.
And obviously, this is not exactly what it looks like,
but it gives you the sense.
This right here, this is the proximal tubule.
And it sounds like a very fancy word, but proximal just
means near and tubule, you can imagine, is just a small tube.
So it 's a small tube that' s near the beginning.
That 's why it' s called a proximal tubule.
And it has two parts.
The whole thing is often called a
proximal convoluted tubule.
The way I 've drawn it is all curvy.
And I just drew it curvy in two dimensions.
It 's actually curvy in three dimensions.
But the reality is there 's a curvy part and then there' s a
straight part near the end of the proximal tubule.
So we 'll call this whole thing the proximal tubule.
This is the convoluted part.
That 's the straight part, but we don' t
have to get too picky.
But the whole point of this part of the nephron - - and just
to remember where we are, we 're now at this point of the
nephron right there - - the whole point is to start
reabsorbing some of the stuff that is in the filtrate that
we don 't want to lose.
We don 't want to lose glucose.
That 's hard - earned stuff that we ate that
was good for energy.
We don 't want to lose necessarily as much sodium.
We 've seen in multiple videos that that' s a useful ion to
have around.
We don 't want to lose amino acids.
Those are useful for building up proteins and other things.
So these are things we don 't want to lose so we start
absorbing them back.
I 'll do a whole video on exactly how that happens, but
it 's done actively.
Since we 're using ATP, and just as a bit of a summary,
you 're using ATP to actually pump out the sodium and then
that actually helps bring in the other things.
That 's just kind of a tidbit on what' s happening.
So we 're reabsorbing, so just imagine what' s happening.
You have cells lining the proximal tubule right now.
And actually, they have little things that jut out.
I 'll do a whole video on that because it' s actually
interesting.
So you have cells out here.
On the other side of the cells, you have an arterial
system, or a capillary system, I should say, actually.
So let 's say you have a capillary system here that is
very close to the cells lining the proximal tubule, and so
this stuff actually gets actively pumped, especially
the sodium, but all of it, using energy, gets pumped back
into the blood selectively, and maybe a
little bit of our water.
So we 're pumping back some sodium, some glucose, and
we 'll start pumping a little bit of the water back in
because we don 't want to lose all of that water.
If all of the water that was originally in the filtrate we
were just leaving in our urine, we 'd be excreting
gallons and gallons of water every day, which we do not
want to do.
So that 's the whole point.
We 're starting the absorption process.
And then we 'll enter the loop of Henle, and actually, this
is, in my mind, the most
interesting part of the nephron.
So we 're entering the loop of Henle, and it dips down, and
then comes back up.
And so most of the length of the nephron
is the loop of Henle.
And if I go back to this diagram right here, if I 'm
talking about the loop of Henle, I 'm talking about this
whole thing right there.
And you can see something interesting here.
It crosses the border between the cortex, this light brown
part, and the renal medulla, this kind of reddish or orange
part right there, and it does that for a very good reason.
I 'm going to draw it here.
So let 's say this is the dividing line right here.
This right here was the cortex.
This right here is the medulla.
So the whole point - - well, there 's two points
of the loop of Henle.
this by actively pumping out salts.
So it actively pumps out salts, and it does that in the
ascending part of the loop of Henle.
So it actively pumps out salts: sodium, potassium,
chloride, or chlorine, I should say.
Chlorine ions.
It actively pumps out these salts right here to make the
entire medulla salty, or if we think about it in terms of
kind of osmosis, make it hypertonic.
You have more solute out here than you have in the filtrate
that 's going through the tubules.
And it uses ATP to do this.
All of this stuff requires ATP to actively pump against a
So this is salty and it 's salty for a reason.
It 's not just to take back these salts from the filtrate,
although that 's part of the reason, but by making this
salty, the ascending part is only permeable to these salts
and these ions.
The descending part of the loop of Henle is only
permeable to water.
If this is all salty because the ascending part is actively
pumping out salt, what 's going to happen to water as it goes
down the descending loop?
Well, it 's hypertonic out here.
Water will naturally want to go and kind of try to make the
concentrations balance out.
I 've done a whole video on that.
It doesn 't happen by magic.
And so the water will - - because this is hypertonic,
it 's more salty, and this is only permeable to water, the
water will leave the membrane on the descending part of the
loop of Henle right now.
And this is a major part of water reabsorption.
I 've thought a lot about why don' t we use ATP somehow to
actively pump water?
And the answer there is, there 's no
easy way to do that.
Biological systems are good at using ATP to pump out ions,
but it can 't actively pump out water.
Water 's kind of a hard thing for proteins to operate on.
So the solution is to make it salty out here by pumping out
ions and then water, if you make this porous only to
water, water will naturally flow out.
So this is a major mechanism of gaining back a lot of the
water that gets filtered out up here.
And the reason why this is so long is to give time for this
water to secrete out, and that 's why it dips nice and
pretty far down into this salty portion.
So then we 'll leave the loop of Henle and then we' re almost
done with the nephron.
Then we 're in another convoluted tubule, and you
might even guess the name of this convoluted tubule.
If this was the proximal one, this is the distal one.
And actually, just to make my drawing correct, it actually
passes very close to the Bowman 's capsule, so let me do
it in a different color.
the Bowman 's capsule.
And once again, I 've made it all convoluted in two
dimensions, but it 's actually convoluted in three.
And it 's not that long, but I just had to get over here and
I wanted to get over that point right there.
It 's called distal.
Distal is further away.
It 's convoluted and it' s a tubule.
So this right here is the distal convoluted tubule, and
here we have more reabsorption: calcium, more
sodium reabsorption.
We 're just reabsorbing more things that we didn' t want to
lose in the first place.
There 's a lot of things we could talk about what get
reabsorbed, but this is just the overview.
And we 're also reabsorbing a little bit of more water.
But then at the end right here, our
filtrate has been processed.
A lot of the water 's been taken out.
It 's a lot more concentrated.
We 've reabsorbed a lot of the salts,
electrolytes that we want.
We 've reabsorbed the glucose and a lot of the amino acids.
Everything that we want, we 've taken back.
We 've reabsorbed.
And so this is mainly waste products and water that we
don 't need anymore and then this gets dumped into
collecting ducts.
kidney, where multiple nephrons are going
to dump into this.
So that might be the distal tubule of another nephron
right here and this is a collecting duct, which is just
a tube that 's collecting all the
byproducts of the nephrons.
And the interesting thing is that the collecting duct
further goes into the medulla again.
It goes into the medulla again to the salty part again.
So if we 're talking about the collecting duct, maybe the
collecting ducts come back into the medulla, collecting
all of the filtrate from the different nephrons.
And because it goes back through that super salty spot
in the medulla, we actually have [a] hormone called
anti - diuretic hormone that can dictate how porous this
collecting tube is, and if it makes it very porous, it
allows more water to leave as we go to the medulla, because
this is very salty, so the water will
leave if this is porous.
And when we do that, what that does is it makes the
filtrate - - and we can maybe start calling it urine now - -
even more concentrated so we lose even less water, and it
keeps collecting, collecting, collecting until we end up
here, and it leaves the kidney and goes via our ureters to
the urinary bladder.
So hopefully, you found that helpful.
I think the neatest thing here is just how we actively
reabsorb the water and how we - - well, actually, in my
mind, that is the neatest part in the loop of Henle.

The answers are get, keep, and grow - - are the three parts of customer relationships.
As we 'll see, customer relationships start with get.
Get is how you actually acquire customers and get them to purchase your product.
Keep - - just like it sounds.
How do you keep customers for long period of time rather than losing the ones
you 've spent all the money acquiring?
And then grow is a neat trick that smart companies do - - is that they understand that it 's a lot
more expensive to get customers than to keep them and grow them.
And so they figure out how to sell existing customers more products.
Get, keep and grow - - the three components of customer relationships.

Let 's just think about this.
Which are the reasons that you would want to partner?
Take a look at this list and choose all that apply.

Of course, the idea that nodes connected in a social network are also more likely
to share other characteristics is what homophily is about.

This brings us to a point where we can ask one of the most fundamental questions in theoretical
computer science and that is does P = NP and in particular, here 's what we actually know.
This is true. We know that every problem that 's in P is in NP and every problem that is NP is in EXP,
that is to say any problem that you can solve in polynomial time,
we can certainly solve in non - deterministic polynomial time,
and any problem that we can solve in a non - deterministic polynomial time,
we can also solve in exponential time, but here 's what we don' t know.
It could be the case that the class NP is actually equal to the class EXP.
That is to say the set of problems that we can solve in a non - deterministic polynomial time
might be exactly the same as the ones that we can solve in exponential time.
So there 's a sort of outer set and that' s distinct from say this inner set,
which is the set of problems that are solvable in polynomial time.
There 's one other thing that we know, we do know that there really
is a difference between polynomial and exponential time.
There 's some problems that can be solved in exponential time that are definitely not NP.
So we know those two things are different, but we don 't really know.
It could be that NP is equal to x. It could also that P is equal to NP.
So the problems that we can solve in a non - deterministic polynomial time
might be exactly the same as the ones that we can solve in polynomial time,
which both would be then different from exponential time
or could very well be that there are really three different categories here.
That problems that are in NP don 't necessarily require exponential time,
but they may not be solvable in polynomial time either - - we don 't know.
So this question of whether or not P = NP, whether we 're in this case here is a pretty heavy question.
So what happens if P does equal NP. Well, a lot people say a lot of different things.
Let 's turn this into a quiz to see what you think.
So one possibility is that cryptographic protocols, so things were keeping secrets in encrypting data
that are based on problems like factoring that are in NP could be cracked.
Another is that there 's a whole lot of computer science theoreticians
who will be suddenly out of work because they will no longer be having to think about this problem.
Another possible outcome might be that with P equal to NP
that means the computers will be smarter than people.
They will be able to solve problems fast that people can 't.
So I don 't know, just tell me which one you think is true.

So let 's take a look at channel economics, but this time assume you are in
original equipment manufacture and your product becomes some other customer 's cost of goods.
So let 's assume this diagram on the top is a laptop computer sold for a computer reseller channel.
And let 's say this laptop sells for $3000 and like any other channel,
the end user assumes they get a discount.
The reseller is taking a profit but gee that reseller was actually buying these laptops
from a master distributor.
Now remember, back here the manufacturer of the laptop had their cost of goods
sometimes abbreviated COGS, which include manufacturing costs, components, etc.
And finally, they had their sales costs, their R & amp; D costs, and their general and administrative costs.
And finally, after all that, they make a profit.
So where do you fit? This is just a laptop manufacturer.
Assume this is Apple or HP. But in this case, you were a graphics chips supplier to Apple or HP.
And you were just one single component on their motherboard.
Well, if you really think about it, you were fitting in here in their costs of goods.
And now your cost of goods; your sales, general, and administrative costs;
your profit; and now your reseller costs.
Now, in some cases, you might 've been selling directly your parts in to HP or Apple
and you would not have reseller costs but you would have more direct sales costs.
Remember, this stands for sales, general, and administrative costs and so your profit is miniscule
compared to what the laptop manufacturer is making but you might be selling millions
of single chips and so that profit is multiplied by that high volume when you OEM a product.

She wants to save 1 / 3 of her money for a trip.
How many dollars should she set aside?
So we essentially want to think about what 1 / 3 of 48 is.
Use 48 as the denominator and find an
equivalent fraction to 1 / 3.
to say, OK, we want 1 / 3 of her money, but we want to write
this as an equivalent fraction where we have 48 in the
This is equal to something over 48.
So how can we get it to that something over 48?
So let 's think about what this means for a second.
So 1 / 3, if we were to draw 1 / 3, it looks like this.
You could imagine a box or a pie, I guess.
So let 's say that this is my pie, and I have it split into
So let me split it into three even pieces.
And 1 / 3 is one of those three pieces.
That is what 1 / 3 means.
Now, if we want express this as a fraction over 48, how can
we do that?
Well, we 're going to have to split this
thing into 48 pieces.
How can we split something into 48?
Well, 3 times 16 is 48, so if we split each of these into 16
pieces - - and it 's going to be hard to draw
here, but you can imagine.
Let 's see, you split it into two, now we' ve split it into
four, now you split it into eight.
You 're just going to end up with a bunch of lines here,
but you can imagine, you can just split each of these.
If you split each of these into enough, you would have 16
pieces, so those would be 16 right there.
You would have 16 right there and you have 16 right there.
And I can just keep doing it.
Let me do it in the green over here.
So if we just kept splitting it up, we would get 48,
because you have this first third would be 16 pieces, the
second third would be 16, and then this third
third would be 16 pieces.
Altogether, you would have 48 pieces.
Now, that 1 / 3, what does that represent?
Well, that represents 16 of the 48.
It represents these 16 right here.
It represents these 16 right there, so 1 over 3 is the
exact same thing.
So 1 over 3 is the exact same thing as 16 over 48.
Now, we did it just by thinking about it kind of
intuitively what 1 / 3 of 48 is, but one way to do it more - - I
guess a process for doing it - - we would say, well, look, to
get the denominator, the bottom number, from 3 to 48,
That 's what we did.
Now, you can 't just multiply only the denominator by 16.
You have to multiply the numerator by the same number.
And so if each of my pieces now become 16 pieces, then
So one way to think about it, you just say, well, 3 times 16
So 1 / 3 is equal to 16 / 48.
And another way you could think about it, which you 'll
learn in more detail later on, is we want 1 / 3 of 48, right?
And when you multiply - - let me write it like this - - 1 / 3 times
48, and you could rewrite 48 as a fraction 48 / 1.
It literally represents 48 wholes.
And when you multiply fractions, you can just
multiply the numerators.
So this is equal to 48 over - - and then you just multiply the
48 / 3, 1 times 48 is 48.
We 'll see this in more detail in the future.
Don 't worry about it if it confuses you.
In the denominator, 3 times 1 is 3, and 48 divided by 3, or
48 / 3, is equal to 16.
So 1 / 3 of 48 is 16, or 16 / 48 is 1 / 3.
Hopefully, that make sense to you.

So what defines a partner?
What 's really interesting is that this has to be a 2 - way street.
One way we say that is shared economics.
Not only do you have to get something out of the relationship,
but so do they, and so you really need to understand
what 's in it for your partner.
A classic start - up mistake is understanding why you need them
but not being able to articulate why it is that they would need you.
They should need you not only for success,
but boy if they don 't have you, they should understand that their business might fail.
A partner might also take a form of co - development or co - invention,
or you might share common customers.
But, one of the things to remember is all the books about partnerships
and all the literature you read tend to be about partnerships
of companies the same size.
But you are a tiny speck to most potential partners.
Remember, you 're a start - up, and that means they barely could see you,
and so there are some special pitfalls,
some special things to talk about throughout the rest of this presentation.

We learned in the imaginary numbers video, that hopefully
you 've watched, that every now and then in certain equations
you end up with a square root of a negative number.
You know, you end up with square root of negative one or
square root of negative nine.
And since any real number, when you square it, is either zero or
positive, this was undefined for us.
And then in order to make it defined in that video, people
came up with this thing called i.
And you can call that the imaginary unit,
or just the number i.
And you define i as saying, well if i squared - - we 'll
just make a definition.
This thing called i when you square it,
it equals negative one.
And then that simplifies the idea of taking a
negative square root.
Because then you could say, oh well the square root of
negative nine is the same thing as i times the square root
of nine, which equals threei.
And how can we say that?
Well, what happens when you square this thing?
So what 's threei squared?
threei squared is equal to three squared times i squared.
This is just exponent properties.
And that equals nine times negative one, which
equals negative nine.
So threei squared is equal to negative nine.
And then if we are kind of extending the definition of
square roots to negative numbers, then we can go the
other way around and we could say threei is equal to the
square root of negative nine.
And threei we can call an imaginary number.
And the word is "imaginary," but it 's as real as anything.
I mean to some degree, do negative numbers even exist?
They 're just kind of a way of us - - when we put this sign in
front of things, it just tells us something about how it
relates to this magnitude.
Anyway, I don 't want to confuse you.
But imaginary numbers tend to get a bad rap because they 're
called imaginary numbers, so some people think that they
exist less than other things.
But with that said, any number times this imaginary unit
i is an imaginary number.
When you do the quadratic equation you realize that
sometimes you end up with a number that has a
little bit of both.
It has a real part and an imaginary part.
So let me give you an example of that.
Let 's say I have the number five plus twoi.
That number you might say, oh, well maybe I can simplify it.
But you really can 't.
You can 't add a real number plus an imaginary number.
You can almost kind of imagine them - - and I don 't want to use
the word "imagine" too much - - as in different dimensions.
And so a number that has a real part, like the five, and an
imaginary part, like the twoi, this is called a
complex number.
And you could, if you want, even graph a complex number.
Let me see.
You could make the vertical axis.
The vertical axis you could call it the imaginary axis.
And you could make the horizontal axis the real axis.
This is a symbol for the set of real numbers.
And five plus twoi, well it 's real part is five.
So one, two, three, four, five.
That 's five.
And it 's imaginary part is twoi, so you go along the imaginary
axis, or the i - axis you could even say, two.
And then you would have this number here called five plus twoi.
In future videos I 'll actually do examples where we' ll make
more use of complex numbers.
But now that we 've defined what a complex number is, let' s see
how we can operate with it.
So what happens when we add two complex numbers?
Clear image.
So let 's say we have two complex numbers.
One is a plus bi.
So the real part is a, the imaginary part is bi.
And let 's say that I have another complex
number, c plus di.
And in general the symbol that people tend to use - - you know,
you always use x for when you 're dealing with equations.
Right?
Like x could be any general real number when you 're
dealing with an equation.
In complex numbers the convention is to use
z, the letter z.
So, for example, we could call this the complex
number z sub one.
And it could have been any.
I mean, this choice of z is arbitrary.
This is an i right here.
This could be z sub two.
So what is the complex number z sub one plus z sub two?
Well that equals this, a plus bi, plus - - this is z sub
two right here - - c plus di.
Let me switch colors.
This is getting monotonous.
So when you add two complex numbers, all you do is you add
the real parts to each other and you add the complex
parts to each other.
So that equals a plus b - - oh sorry.
The real parts.
So it 's a and c.
Those are the real parts.
So that equals a plus c plus - - and then you add
the imaginary parts.
b plus d times i.
So you have b i 's and d i' s.
So when you add them together you have b plus d i 's.
b plus d in the imaginary direction, you can
almost imagine.
I 'm using the word imagine too much.
So it 's pretty easy.
You just add the real and you add the imaginary parts.
So what happens if you multiply two complex numbers?
And actually, let 's just go in order.
What happens when you subtract them?
Well, it 's the same thing.
Nothing fancy here. z sub one minus z sub two.
That 's just going to be equal to - - you subtract
the real parts.
a minus c.
And that 's the new real part.
And then you subtract the imaginary parts.
b minus d times i.
And this will be the new imaginary part.
So this will be the new complex number.
What happens when I multiply the two numbers?
So what is z sub one times z sub two?
Well that equals a plus bi times c plus di.
And we essentially can just FOIL it out.
I don 't know if you' ve learned FOIL in eightth grade algebra,
nineth grade algebra.
I don 't like it.
I actually just think of it as the distributive
property twice.
So what we could do is we can take the c plus di
and distribute it on each of these terms.
Right?
So this should be equal to a times c plus di.
Right?
Plus bi times c plus di.
Right?
All I did is I took the c plus di and I multiplied it by this
to get this, and multiplied it by this to get this.
And then we distribute again.
We get ac plus adi - - this is an i.
I know my i 's aren' t looking good.
adi plus - - now what 's bi times c?
Well that 's cbi.
And then we have bi times di.
So you get b times d, which is bd.
And then what 's i times i?
It 's i squared, or negative one.
Right?
Times negative one.
So what does this simplify to?
Well this simplifies to - - I 'm going to go back here.
So let 's see what the real parts are.
We have this term, a times c, that 's real.
So ac.
And then this last term, which was bi times di.
Because we 're multiplying i times i we get a negative one,
but it becomes real again.
Right?
So we get negative bd minus bd.
So that 's our new real part.
So that was this term and that term are real.
And now what 's our new imaginary part?
Well it 's going to be these two terms added together.
So it 's - - I' m running out of space again - - ad plus
cb, all of that times i.
It 's a little easier with real numbers, and maybe in the next
video I 'll use real numbers.
But the important thing to realize is essentially you just
use the distributive property and realize that you can only
add real terms to each other.
You can 't add a real to an imaginary.
And you can only add imaginary terms to each other.
And just remember, when you have two imaginary numbers
times each other, the i 's, when multiplied times each other,
and you get negative one.
Now the last operation, when you divide complex numbers.
This gets a little bit interesting, and maybe
a little unintuitive.
So what happens if I divide z sub one by z sub two?
So once again that equals a plus bi, divided by c plus di.
How do I divide this?
Well, we 're going to use a property that hopefully
you learned in algebra.
That if I multiply - - let me do this in this corner.
a plus b times a minus b.
What does that equal?
That equals a squared minus b squared.
And so if I multiply a complex number.
Let 's say, in theory, I multiply a complex number c
plus di times c minus di.
What do I get?
I get c squared minus di squared.
And what 's di squared going to be?
It 's d squared times negative one, so it becomes c squared - -
oh, I 'm out of time.
Actually, let me continue the division in the next video,
because it can get involved.
See you soon.

All right, so to do the last little bit of this proof to show that 3 - colorability is NP hard,
we 're going to show that if we had the ability to solve 3 - colorability problems in polynomial time,
then we could solve three SAT problems in polynomial time as well,
and so what we need to be able to do to show that is if you walk up to me with any 3 - CNF formula,
I can quickly turn it into a 3 - colorability problem, which is going to be a graph
such that that graph is 3 colorable if and only if the original formula
the 3 - CNF formula that were given is satisfiable.
So CNF here just means conjunctive normal form.
It 's just that form that I showed you before where the formula is the n of a bunch of clauses
and each clause is the or of three literals and each literal is either variable or its negation,
not the variable, so you walk up to me with 3 - CNF problem,
I turn that into a 3 - colorability problem that can be colored if and only if the formula is satisfiable.
Sounds like an interesting challenge. So let 's get to it. What we' re going to be doing is building a graph.
We 'll start off by creating some nodes with one node for every possible literal in the formula.
So that 's the k different variables of let' s say this, just to be concrete.
This formula that we come to has k variables and s clauses and we 're going to add three more nodes.
We 'll call them true, false, and slack. I' m going to connect up the nodes initially as follows.
Each literal will be connected to slack including true and false
and we 're going to connect true and false to each other.
What that means because there 's a little triangle here and
we 're trying see whether or not it' s 3 - colorable.
The only way that this thing could be 3 colorable is if these three are given three different colors.
So just for concreteness, let 's say that the color that slack gets is red.
The color that true gets is blue, true blue and the color that false gets is black, black. False won.
All right, so the graph that we have so far has the property that each of these literals is
going to have be colored either true or false, blue or black, if we 're going to 3 color the whole graph.
So that 's good, that kind of make it seem like they' re actually getting truth assignments.
We have to be a little careful though because literal Vâ and literal not Vâ can 't both be true
and they can 't both be false but that' s an easy thing to fix in a graph colorability problem.
We just connect them with an edge.
So we add one edge for each variable connecting the pair of literals
that can 't both be true and both be false.
Now what happens is the only way that we can 3 color this is if each variable is given a blue for
either the variable and black for its negation or black for the variable
and blue for the negation and that 's like a truth assignment.
A true / false assignment to that variable..
So any possible truth assignment, corresponds to a 3 coloring.
Any possible 3 coloring, corresponds to the truth assignment.
So far we 're in really good shape as far as capturing the idea of the physics of a SAT problem.

So the consequences of understanding a new market are essential for a startup.
This was a startup killer for decades.
In a new market, there are no customers, so revenues might extend out for years.
In fact, if you think about what happened during the dot - com bubble,
in the beginning of the 21st century is every startup executed like they were in an existing market.
They hired sales people, they spent marketing dollars, and in scale of tens of millions or dollars
trying to create and use your demands for a market that didn 't exist.
Just imagine what would 've happened if those start - ups would' ve parked their capital in a bank
getting interest and doing??? activities to help start the market because the market wasn 't there.
There is no way any individual startup can accelerate technology diffusion.
So for a new market to take off, lots of things external to your startup need to happen.
Regulation needs to change. Platforms need to become cheaper.
Customer cases need to change, etc.
The dot - com bubble was actually predicated on all these things happening all at once
and they didn 't, and therefore, all that money that got raised
got spent trying to acquire customers when they were none.
The test for whether you 're in a new market is not whether 30 people in your regional cluster,
or in Silken Valley, or New York have heard about your technology.
The real test is whether your grandmother in Omaha or Berlin or in Uganda
actually have heard about the technology or the product or the market.
And if the market doesn 't exist there, you might be spending a lot of money
trying to create a market where there is none.
Premature spending is the killer for startups.

Now that you 've completed Lecture 2 on the value proposition,
here 's the optional reading for next week.
In Business Model Generation it 's pages 146 to 150, 161 to 168, and 200 to 211.
And in the Startup Owner 's Manual read pages 85 through 97, 112 to 125,
203 to 221, and 260 to 266.
But the homework is now you actually are getting out and talking to customers
to explicitly find out details about your value proposition - -
not only your product and features, which is fairly easy,
but what are the pain relievers and gain creators along with the key features?
What do customers really think?
Are people excited because it solves a problem?
Do they like your solution?
And when you do enough of this, what 's the resulting minimum viable product?
And again, you need to propose experiments to test your value proposition
along with pass / fail signals.
The link below has some examples of teams that have done that.
Update your business model canvas with changes
and optionally use the LaunchPad Central software
and post this week 's discovery narratives.

Use less than, greater than or equal to compare the two
fractions 21 / 28 and 6 / 9.
Now, your impulse might just be to look at these numbers
and say, oh, look, these are larger numbers than those.
This must be bigger.
You cannot do that.
And we 'll talk about in future videos on why that is, or I
encourage you to think about why you cannot do that, but to
do it properly, at least in my mind, the best way is to get
these both in simplified forms and to just think about what
they represent.
And in the future when we learn to convert them to
decimals, that 's actually the best way to do it, or actually
for me, the easiest way.
But let 's try to do what we can so far.
So 21 / 28, we want to put this in simplified form.
21 is the same thing as 3 times 7.
28 is the same thing as 4 times 7.
They 're both divisible by 7.
Now, if you divide the numerator and the denominator
by 7, 3 times 7 divided by 7 is just going to be 3.
4 times 7 divided by 7 is just going to be 4.
So this guy right here is 3 / 4, is equivalent to 3 / 4.
Now, let 's think about what 6 / 9 is.

Since these numbers are smaller, this is actually a
good chance to visualize it.
So let 's visualize if we have ninths, let me draw the 9
ninths first. So if I were to split it into thirds, I just
want to make it so it 's reasonably - -
oh, that 's not right.
Maybe there and there, and then divide each of these into
thirds, so just like that, a little bit more space to that
one, and then we have it like that, and then
Let me draw it like that.
So here we have 9 pieces of a candy bar, whatever you want
to think about it, or 9 / 9.
6 / 9 literally means one, two, three, four, five six.
6 / 9 references 6 of the 9 potential pieces, 6 of these
one - ninth of a candy bar piece, however you want to
think about it.
Now, 6 is the same thing as 2 times 3, so you can view it as
two groups of 3.
Let me do it this way.
You can view it as two groups of 3.
So this is one group of 3.
group of 3.
Now, what is 9 equivalent to?
9 is equivalent to 3 times 3, or three groups of 3.
So 9 is equivalent to that 's one group of 3, that is two
groups of 3, and now this is three groups of 3.

And these two groups of 3 that the 6 represents, if we just
draw the groups of three, it would be that guy and that the
So how many thirds do we have, if you consider each of those
groups of three as a third?
Well, we have 2 / 3.
This is equivalent to 2 / 3.
But doing the process that we 're used to doing, we could
9 is 3 times 3.
If you divide 2 times 3 by 3, you get 2.
If you divide 3 times 3 by 3, you get the 3.
So 6 / 9 is the same thing as 2 / 3, two of the thirds, of the
one - thirds.
That 's what 6 / 9 is equivalent to.
Now, let 's think about what' s larger.
2 / 3, which is the same thing as 6 / 9, or 3 / 4?
I didn 't do 21 / 28 because it would' ve
taken forever to draw.
So what does 3 / 4 look like?
What is 3 / 4?
So if we were to take this exact same square - - so
let me redraw it.
So if we were to take that same exact candy bar, so these
three pieces, if we were to cut it up into four pieces,
what do we get?
So let 's see, that' s cutting up into two pieces, and now
So now this one has fourths, this one has thirds.
3 in the denominator here - - so let me make it very clear.
This represents 2 / 3.
Now, this is going to represent, we have four
pieces, and if we 're coloring in three of them, so if we' re
talking about 3 / 4, that 's one - - let me draw it like
this, actually.
That is one, two - - let me scroll up a
And the way I drew it, it is not completely obvious to you.
Actually, the way I drew it because - - let me draw it a
little bit neater than this.
Let me draw it a little bit neater and it 'll become a
little bit more obvious.
I didn 't draw the fourths.
Here, drawing neatly actually matters.
So let me draw it like that and then split
this group - - nope.
I want to make it even, so I want to make it like this.
OK, so if those are the fourths, if we 're talking
about three of the fourths, we 're talking about one, two,
three fourths, and you can see that 3 / 4 is larger than 2 / 3.
2 / 3 gets us to this far of the candy bar, while 3 / 4 is a
little bit more of the candy bar.
2 / 3 is about that far, 3 / 4 is even more, so 3 / 4
is larger than 2 / 3.
And we 'll show you in the future how to do it
numerically.
You can use a calculator, if you like, or you could do it
by hand, but you can see from this visually that 3 / 4 is
greater than 2 / 3.

Now, they want to compare these two fractions.
So 21 / 28 is the same thing as 3 / 4.
So 21 / 28 is going to be greater than 2 / 3, which is the
And so we are done.


Simplify 48 / 64 to lowest terms.
Let 's see if we can visualize this.
So let 's say that' s a whole.
Maybe we 're talking about a candy bar.
Let me draw the whole.
We 're talking about a whole candy bar.
That would be 64 fourths.
And 48 of the 64, you could imagine splitting this up into
64 super - small pieces.
You wouldn 't be able to see what I drew here, but if we
had 48 of them, it would get us about that much of them, so
that would be the 48 out of the 64.
So this whole blue area is 64.
The 48 is this purple area right over here.
So let me write it over here.
48 / 64, and we want to write it in lowest terms, and we 'll
talk more about what lowest terms even means.
Now, is there a way to group these 48 or these 64 into
groups of numbers that will maybe simplify
And to think about that, you 'd have to think about what is
the largest factor that is common to both 48 and 64?
Or you can think of it as what is their
greatest common divisor?
Well, the largest number that I can think of that goes into
48 - - you could do it either by just thinking about it or you
could actually write out all of its factors.
But if you were to write all the factors for 48 and all the
that goes into both is 16.
So you could say that 48 is equal to - - well, what is it?
It 's 3 times 16, and 64 is 4 times 16.
Now this is interesting.
So this 48 that we drew in magenta right here, we could
view this as three groups of 16.
So that 's one, two - - let me make them a
little bit more even.
So one, two, three groups of 16, so that 's 16, that' s 16,
and that is 16.
That would be 48.
I could draw 16 bars here so that we have 16 pieces, but
that 's a group of 16, a group of 16 and a group of 16.
That 's what 48 is.
Now, 64 is four groups of 16.
So we could make, if you look at the 64, that is a 16, that
is a 16, that is a 16, and then that is another 16.
These should all be the same length.
I drew it a little bit off.
So what is 48 / 64 in lowest terms?
We want to write this in as simple as possible fraction.
Well, if we make each of the pieces equal to 16 of our old
pieces, if we make this into one piece, if we turn 16 into
one, then we are talking about instead of 48 / 64, we 're
talking about three.
So this is one piece, two pieces, three pieces of a
total of four.
So this is going to be equal to 3 / 4.
And hopefully, you see kind of a mathematical way of
immediately thinking about it.
If you can factor this out and you can actually factor out
its greatest common factor, so 48 is 3 times 16, 64 is 4
times 16, and then these cancel each other out.
view This is equivalent to 3 / 4 times 16 / 16.
And 16 / 16 is 1, and you 're just left with 3 / 4.
Now, if you didn 't immediately recognize that 16 goes into
both 48 and 64, you could do it step by step.
So let 's say we started off with 48 / 64.
Now, the key thing to remember with any fraction, whatever
So let 's say we divide the numerator by 2, we also have
We know that these are both divisible by 2.
They 're both even.
So that would get us to 24 / 32.
both divisible by 2.
Well, see if we can think of a larger number.
Well, actually, they 're both divisible by 4, so maybe you
don 't realize that they' re also both divisible by 8.
So let 's say you did it with 4.
So now we divide the top by 4.
So we 're going to divide by 4.
We get 6.
You have to do the same to the bottom, to the denominator.
Divide by 4, you get 8.
So 48 / 64 is the same thing as 24 / 32, which is the
same thing as 6 / 8.
And these are both divisible by 2, so if you divide the
numerator by 2, you get 3.
You divide that the denominator by 2, you get 4.
And so this is the simplest possible terms, because 3 and
4 share no common factors greater than 1, so we 're in
lowest possible terms.
The easiest way or the fastest way is to say, hey, 16 is the
Divide both by 16.
You get 3 / 4.
And really when you 're dividing the numerator and
denominator by 16, you 're turning groups of 16 into one
piece or 16 super - small pieces of the pie into one bigger
piece of the pie.
So this goes from 64 pieces to 4 pieces.

So let’s follow our Jersey Square team down
and see what they’ve done for customer
relationships. We’ll it’s really interesting to
remember when they first started. Customer
relationships for then said search ads, social
medium and stadium promotions. And there
was nothing wrong with that. But really
what they discovered is that they were actually
just talking about the customer acquisition
portion, or the get portion of customer
relationships. But we really want teams to
understand, what you can do to keep customers
long - term, and what are you going to do
to grow them in the next couple of years as we.
So we ask you to think about get, keep
and grow. And they did a good job of
getting out of the building and doing that.

So, that’s all I’d like to say about Path Links for
now. Next I want to focus for a little while on the
notion of a clustering coefficient. Now, you might
be less familiar with this notion of clustering
coefficient than you are with paths and graphs, so
let’s go through how this is often defined.
What the clustering coefficient is trying to capture is,
as I said before, cliquishness. How likely is it that
two nodes that are connected are part of some kind
of larger highly connected group of nodes? So one
typical way of defining the clustering coefficient is to
start - off by taking about the clustering coefficient for
a particular node in a graph, I’m going to generalize
this to clustering coefficients for the entire graph
next, but let’s focus on a single node. So say, V is
that node and Kv is its degree and Nv of V is the
number of links between the neighbors of V. So, let’s
look at this example graph to ground out some of
these concepts. So here we’ve got graph, let’s call
this node V. Could point to any of them but I’m going
to go with this one. Let’s take a look at the neighbors
of V. Those are the nodes that are directly
connected to V in the graph. We’ve got this one, and
this one, and this one, and this one. So the number
of those neighbors is exactly the degree of V, which
in this case is 4. And now let’s look at the links
between these neighbors of V. So, there is this one
that goes between the two pink nodes and that
seems to be it. This node isn’t connected to any
other pink node. This one is not connected to any
other pink node. This is not connected to any pink
node and so on. So in this case, Nv is 1. And we are
going to combine these quantities together as
follows. We take twice the number of neighbor links
divided by the degree of V times one minus the
degree of V. Now, this may look a little odd but let’s
compute what it is and then I’ll explain it. So in this
case, two times Nv just one, divided by K times K
minus one. So it’s four times three. And the result we
get in this case for this particular V is 1 / 6. So what
this represents is actually the fraction of possible
interconnections between the neighbors of V. So,
because it’s a fraction, we’re expecting it to be
something between zero and one. And in fact we
can get zero if we’ve got something that’s like a star.
So V has edges going out but none of those connect
to each other. And it can actually be all the way to
one if we have a cleek. So V is connected to its
neighbors and all the neighbors are connected to
each other. So that’s why this formula has the form
that it does, Kv times Kv minus one all divided by
two is the maximum number of connections among a
set of nodes of size Kv. So, we take the reciprocal of
that multiplied by Nv that gives us the fraction that
we’re looking for. So, in this case V is a sixth, it’s you
know a six of the way from being a star to being a
cleek. So it’s not that tightly connected and in fact
you know that sort of what we saw as well that V is
connected to a bunch of neighbors but they are not
really connected to each other all that much. I am
going to say that the clustering coefficient for graph
is just the average of the clustering coefficients of
the nodes in the graph. So if we wanted to compute
the clustering coefficient of this graph, we’d actually
have to go through node, to node, to node, to node,
to node, to node, to node, compute the clustering
coefficient for each one and then average.

For the work that it 's doing is it' s going to do a series of swaps
possibly making it all the way to the bottom of the tree but never further than that.
And the comparison, it does a constant number of comparisons at each level.
It does a constant amount of work to do the swap
and it doesn 't have to touch anything else on the tree other than the longest path
and the length of this path is the depth of the tree which is the log n.

There 's only one that' s true here, and that 's that the song seems to have had an
effect on engagement, but not learning. Think of it this way. Let 's assume that
the song had no effect. Let 's say we picked a random sample of size 20 from the
population of learning scores. It 's quite possible. You calculated about an 18%
chance to randomly select a sample with a mean learning score of 8. 35. This is a
pretty high probability. However, again, let 's assume that the song had no
effect and we picked a random sample of size 20 from the population of
engagement scores. We get that the mean engagement score is way out here, with a
z score of over 10. That 's not likely to happen if we pick a random sample.
Therefore, there 's evidence to suggest that the song had an effect on engagement
but not learning. However, we still can 't be totally sure that the song caused
higher engagement without setting up a proper experiment and implementing proper
control conditions. Great job.

I was sent some problems by one of the viewers out there.
I believe his name is Cortaggio or Cortajio, I apologize.
I 'm sure I' m mispronouncing it.
But they are really interesting problems.
What 's interesting about them is that they don' t involve
super - fancy mathematics.
They just involve an elegant way to apply fairly
simple mathematics.
So, without me talking too much about the problems, let 's
try to solve one of them.
Actually, I don 't know where I' m going to categorize this.
Either in algebra or in the brain - teaser playlist,
or maybe both.
So, an officer on horseback starts at the back of a column
of marching soldiers and rides to the front of the column.
Then turns around and rides to the rear of the column.
If the rider travels three times as fast as the column
moves, and the column is 100 meters long - - OK, I think we
have enough information to start drawing this.
Let me draw the column of soldiers.
I 'll just draw this as a big fat line.
So, that 's the column of soldiers.
I 'm about to cough.
Excuse me.
I 've learned not to cough directly in the microphone.
Don 't want blow your speakers out.
So that 's the column of soldiers right there.
And the problem tells us that it 's 100 meters long.
So this distance right here is 100 meters.
And it 's moving with some velocity.
Let 's say, to the right.
So I 'm going to just call it, it' s moving with
some velocity, v.
We 'll have to stay abstract there because it doesn' t
tell us the velocity.
And then we have, what is this, the officer. Is that what they... right.
I wanted to make sure I wasn 't giving the incorrect title.
So, an officer on horseback stars at the back of a column.
So he starts here.
He 's on his horse.
He 's on his horse.
That 's my rendition of the horse for these purposes, it
has an officer on on the back.
And he is going to, while the whole column is going forward
with the velocity, v, he 's going to go to the front of it.
Obviously he can go faster because he 's on a horse.
And then he 's going to go to the back and they want to
know how far did this whole column move.
And how fast is he going?
Let 's see, if the rider travels 3 times as fast as the column,
if the column is this traveling with the velocity v, he 's going
to be traveling with the velocity of 3v.
So let 's think about two things.
Let 's think about the time it takes him to go to the front
of the column, and the time it takes to go back.
So let 's say t1 is equal to time to front.
And then t2 would be time to back.
There might be other ways to solve this, but this is the
way that 's jumping out into my brain.
So let 's figure out what the time to the front
of the column is.
So, over some period of time - - so, how far is the column
going to move over to t1?
The column is going to move, well, actually, let me write
a little formula here.
Although I 'm sure you know this formula.
Distance is equal to rate times time.
Right?
So, over time 1, how far does the column move?
It 's going to move v.
v times time 1.
And how far is this guy going to move?
Well, we 're saying over time, when he moves to
the front of the column.
So, this whole column is moving to the right.
And at the same time, this guy 's moving to
the right faster.
So at the end of time 1, which I 've defined as the time
it takes him to get to the front, what 's true about the
officer on the horseback?
He will have had to travel 100 meters further than
the column, right?
In order to catch up to the front of the column, he would
have had to go 100 meters further than the column.
So, the distance that the column travels, plus 100 meters
is going to be the distance that the officer travels in
the same amount of time.
And what 's the distance that he travels in that
same amount of time?
Well, distance is equal to rate, 3v, times time, t1.
Time to the front.
So this is a relationship between velocity and
the time to the front.
And let 's see if we can simplify this a little bit.
So, if we subtract v t1 from both sides, we get 100 is equal to
3v t1 minus v t1, that 's 2v t1, and divide both sides
by 2, you get 50.
v t1 is equal to 50.
The velocity of this column of soldiers times the time it
takes this officer to get to the front is equal to 50.
Well, that doesn 't solve our problem yet.
We want to know how far does the column move?
We have two variables with one equation.
Not helpful yet.
Let 's see if t2 can help us a little bit?
All right.
I 'll switch colors to ease the monotony.
Time to back.
So, now we 're in the opposite situation, where the
guy 's gotten here.
He turns around.
I 'd argue, immediately.
He turns around immediately.
And he goes back.
With the velocity of 3v.
So, my question to you as he starts out here, and relative
to him, he 's going this direction at a velocity of 3v.
And the back of the column is moving towards him with
the velocity of v, right?
So if you think about it, the back of the column is going to
be approaching the rider with the velocity of 4v.
When you have two velocities that are moving in opposite
directions - - if I move in this direction, at 60 miles per
hour, and you 're moving in that direction at 60 miles per hour.
Relative to me, if I assume that I 'm stationary, you would
look like you 're coming at me at 120 miles per hour.
So that same idea - - this officer is going to be
approaching the end of the column, the back of the column,
with the velocity of 4v.
So how long does it take them to get to the back?
Well, let 's see.
His velocity is 4v.
I 'll do that in green.
So his velocity is 4v.
That 's how fast he' s approaching the back
of the column.
And it 's going to take him time 2, times time 2.
And his distance, he 's going to travel 100 meters, because
that 's the length of the column.
Is equal to 100.
And let 's see, if we divide both sides of this by 4,
we got velocity times time 2 is equal to 25.
And, once again, we have 1 equation with two unknowns.
It doesn 't help a lot.
Let 's review the problem again to see if somehow we can use
this information and this information to solve what
they 're asking for.
So, they want to know how far does the column move by the
time the officer arrives back at the rear of the column.
So, they want to know how far did this whole thing move over
the entire time of this problem happening?
What was the entire time?
It was t1 plus t2.
That 's the entire time. t1 to go to the front, and then
t2 to go back to the back.
So how far did the column move?
Well, the column, distance is equal to rate times time.
So the column will move its distance - - is equal to the
column 's rate, velocity.
And then what 's the time that this whole little
problem occurs on?
Well t1 is how long it takes the officer to
get to the front.
Plus t2.
So this is what we 're solving for.
This is what we need to know.
We need to know the distance traveled by the column.
And, once again, we have all these variables.
But maybe we can do something interesting.
Let 's look at this.
So what is - - so if we just distribute this, we have
distance is equal to v times t1 plus v times t2.
And do we know what these things are?
Well, sure.
We were able to kind of stumble our way into into what
these values are.
And that 's what' s interesting about this problem.
We never figured out v.
We never figured out t1 or t2.
But we can figure out this whole thing.
Because v times t1 - - they tell us, is 50.
So we can substitute it back here.
So the distance is equal to 50.
Plus, what 's v times t2?
Well, we solved it here when we figured out how long it would
take to go back to the front of the column.
So that 's 25.
So that, we 'll put over here.
So the total distance that the column traveled is 50 plus
25 meters, or 75 meters.
And this is a neat problem, because they didn 't tell us
how fast the column is actually going.
They 're just saying it' s v.
They just said that the officer is going 3 times
as fast, but we don 't know absolute velocities.
But we were still able to figure out, even without even
knowing the absolute times, we were still able to figure out
the total distance that the column travelled.
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed that.
And if you did, you can thank Cortagio for the problem.

We can do this by modifying the list < u > component < / u > sizes algorithm from the previous example. Call
the algorithm check connection, and it takes a graph, but it also takes v1 and v2. It 's
going to do something similar to before. It 's going to start off with the assumption that
none of the nodes have been marked so far as reachable. Then we 're going to call marked
component on that graph, and the node that we 're going to start marking from is v1. And
what that 's going to do when this returns - - it' s going to return a number, but we 're just going
to ignore it - - it 's going to go through starting at v1 and mark, like basically touch, every
node that can be reached from v1. And we want to find out whether or not there 's a connection
to v2, and that 's really easy at this point. The answer is v2 in. So what this does is
it checks whether the node v2 that we 've been given as input was one of the nodes that got
marked when we were spreading things out from v1. So it starts at v1, spreads things through
the graph like some kind of an infection or a good idea, and when that 's all through,
all we have to do is look to see whether v2 was one of the things that got infected in
the spread. So according to this, a and g are connected. Let 's take a look back at the
graph. g is reachable from a, but that 's not so exciting to think about because they were
pretty much connected directly. Let 's try a more interesting one, say h and b. It realizes
that h and b are in fact connected, and that 's more interesting because it requires multiple
hops to get from one to the other. And then finally, we can do a and b. We know that they 're
in different components because remember, there was component a with 4 nodes and component
b with 4 nodes, but let 's make sure that the program can figure that out. Yes, indeed.
So when it spread things out from a and reached everywhere it could reach, b was not among
the visited.

Let 's see how we came up with our answer.
Number 1, our pay - per - click number was 75 cents for each customer that we go to our side
and we know we got 4, 025 customers, and so if we multiply that out, we know we 've spent $3, 018.
And on the next number that 's important is that not all 4, 025 actually activated and in fact,
if we look at this number, our conversion number, only 3. 7% converted.
If we multiply that out, we 'll discover that equals about 149 activated customers,
and now if we divide the $3, 018 by these 149 activated customers,
we find out that the customer acquisition cost, the CAC, equals about $20,
more precisely about $20. 27.

It always helps me to see a lot of examples of something so I
figured it wouldn 't hurt to do more scientific
notation examples.
So I 'm just going to write a bunch of numbers and then write
them in scientific notation.
And hopefully this' ll cover almost every case you 'll ever
see and then at the end of this video, we 'll actually do some
computation with them to just make sure that we can
do computation with scientific notation.
Let me just write down a bunch of numbers.
0. 00852.
That 's my first number.
My second number is seven trillion, twelve billion.
I 'm just arbitrarily stopping the zeroes.
The next number is 0. 0000000 I 'll just draw a couple more.
If I keep saying zero, you might find that annoying.
five hundred The next number - - right here, there 's a
decimal right there.
The next number I 'm going to do is the number seven hundred and twenty - three.
The next number I 'll do - - I' m having a lot of seven 's here.
Let 's do 0. 6.
And then let 's just do one more just for, just to make sure
we 've covered all of our bases.
Let 's say we do eight hundred and twenty - three and then let' s throw some - - an
arbitrary number of zero 's there.
So this first one, right here, what we do if we want to write
in scientific notation, we want to figure out the largest
exponent of ten that fits into it.
So we go to its first non - zero term, which
is that right there.
We count how many positions to the right of the decimal point
So it 's going to be equal to this.
So it 's going to be equal to eight - - that' s that guy
right there - - 0. 52.
So everything after that first term is going to
be behind the decimal.
So 0. 52 times 10 to the number of terms we have.
One, two, three.
ten to the minus three.
Another way to think of it: this is a little bit more.
This is like eight one / two thousands, right?
Each of these is thousands.
We have eight one / two of them.
Let 's do this one.
Let 's see how many zero' s we have.
We have three, six, nine, twelve.
So we want to do - - again, we start with our largest
term that we have.
Our largest non - zero term.
In this case, it 's going to be the term all
the way to the left.
That 's our seven.
So it 's going to be 7. 012.
It 's going to be equal to 7. 012 times 10 to the what?
Well it 's going to be times ten to the one with this many zero' s.
So how many things?
We had a one here.
Then we had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve zero 's.
I want to be very clear.
You 're not just counting the zero' s.
You 're counting everything after this first
term right there.
So it would be equivalent to a one followed by twelve zero 's.
So it 's times ten to the twelfth.
Just like that.
Not too difficult.
Let 's do this one right here.
So we go behind our decimal point.
We find the first non - zero number.
That 's our five.
It 's going to be equal to five.
There 's nothing to the right of it, so it' s 5. 00 if we wanted
to add some precision to it.
But it 's five times and then how many numbers to the right, or
behind to the right of the decimal will do we have?
We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, and we
have to include this one, fourteen.
five times ten to the minus fourteenth power.
Now this number, it might be a little overkill to write this
in scientific notation, but it never hurts to get
the practice.
So what 's the largest ten that goes into this?
Well, one hundred will go into this.
And you could figure out one hundred or ten squared by saying, "OK, this
is our largest term. "And then we have two zero 's behind it
because we can say one hundred will go into seven hundred and twenty - three.
So this is going to be equal to 7. 23 times, we could say times
one hundred, but we want to stay in scientific notation, so I 'll
write times ten squared.
Now we have this character right here.
What 's our first non - zero term?
It 's that one right there, so it' s going to be six times and
then how many terms do we have to the right of the decimal?
We have only one.
So times ten to the minus one.
That makes a lot of sense because that 's essentially
equal to six divided by ten because ten to the minus
1 is 1 / 10 which is 0. 6.
One more.
Let me throw some commas here just to make this a
little easier to look at.
So let 's take our largest value right there.
We have our eight.
This is going to be 8. 23 - - we don 't have to add the other
stuff because everything else is a zero - - times ten to the - -
we just count how many terms are after the eight.
So we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
8. 23 times 10 to the 10.
I think you get the idea now.
It 's pretty straightforward.
And more than just being able to calculate this, which is a
good skill by itself, I want you to understand why
this is the case.
Hopefully that last video explained it.
And if it doesn 't, just multiply this out.
Literally multiply 8. 23 times 10 to the 10 and
you will get this number.
Maybe you could try it with something smaller
than ten to the ten.
Maybe ten to the fifth.
And well, you 'll get a different number but
you 'll end up with five digits after the eight.
But anyway, let me do a couple more computation examples.
Let 's say we had the numbers - - let me just make something
really small - - 0. 0000064.
Let me make a large number.
Let 's say I have that number and I want to multiply it.
I want to multiply it by - - let 's say I have a really large
number - - three two - - I 'm just going to throw a bunch of zero' s here.
I don 't know when I' m going to stop.
Let 's say I stop there.
So this one, you can multiply out.
But it 's a little difficult.
But let 's put it into scientific notation.
One, it 'll be easier to represent these numbers and
then hopefully you 'll see that the multiplication actually
gets simplified as well.
So this top guy right here, how can we write him in
scientific notation?
It would be 6. 4 times 10 to the what?
one, two, three, four, five, six.
I have to include the six.
So times ten to the minus six.
And what can this one be written as?
This one is going to be 3. 2.
And then you count how many digits are after the three.
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.
So 3. 2 times 10 to the 11th.
So if we multiply these two things, this is equivalent to six
- - let me do it in a different color - - 6. 4 times 10 to
the minus 6 times 3. 2 times 10 to the 11th.
Which we saw in the last video is equivalent to 6. 4 times 3. 2.
I 'm just changing the order of our multiplication.
Times ten to the minus six times ten to the eleventh power.
And now what will this be equal to?
Well, to do this, I don 't want to use a calculator.
So let 's just calculate it.
So 6. 4 times 3. 2.
Let 's ignore the decimals for a second.
We 'll worry about that at the end.
So two times four is eight, two times six is twelve.
Nowhere to carry the one, so it 's just one hundred and twenty - eight.
Put a zero down there.
three times four is twelve, carry the one.
three times six is eighteen.
You 've got a one there, so it' s one hundred and ninety - two.
Right?
Yeah.
one hundred and ninety - two.
You had them up and you get eight, four, one plus nine is ten.
Carry the one.
You get two.
Now, we just have to count the numbers behind
the decimal point.
We have one number there, we have another number there.
We have two numbers behind the decimal point,
so you count one, two.
So 6. 4 times 3. 2 is equal to 20. 48 times 10 to the - - we
have the same base here, so we can just add the exponents.
So what 's minus six plus eleven?
So that 's ten to the fifth power, right?
Right.
Minus six and eleven.
ten to the fifth power.
And so the next question, you might say, "I 'm done.
I 've done the computation. "And you have.
And this is a valid answer.
But the next question is is this in scientific notation?
And if you wanted to be a real stickler about it, it 's not in
scientific notation because we have something here that could
maybe be simplified a little bit.
We could write this - - let me do it this way.
Let me divide this by ten.
So any number we can multiply and divide by ten.
So we could rewrite it this way.
We could write one / ten on this side and then we can multiply
times ten on that side, right?
That shouldn 't change the number.
You divide by ten and multiply it by ten.
That 's just like multiplying by one or dividing by one.
So if you divide this side by 10, you get 2. 048.
You multiply that side by ten and you get times ten to
the - - times ten is just times ten to the first.
You can just add the exponents.
Times ten to the sixth.
And now, if you 're a stickler about it, this is good
scientific notation right there.
Now, I 've done a lot of multiplication.
Let 's do some division.
Let 's divide this guy by that guy.
So if we have 3. 2 times 10 to the eleventh power divided by
6. 4 times 10 to the minus six, what is this equal to?
Well, this is equal to 3. 2 over 6. 4.
We can just separate them out because it 's associative.
So, it 's this times ten to the eleventh over ten to
the minus six, right?
If you multiply these two things, you 'll
get that right there.
So 3. 2 over 6. 4.
This is just equal to 0. 5, right?
32 is half of 64 or 3. 2 is half of 6. 4, so this
is 0. 5 right there.
And what is this?
This is ten to the eleventh over ten to the minus six.
So when you have something in the denominator, you
could write it this way.
This is equivalent to ten to the eleventh over ten to the minus six.
It 's equal to ten to the eleventh times ten to the
minus six to the minus one.
Or this is equal to ten to the eleventh times ten to the sixth.
And what did I do just there?
This is one over ten to the minus six.
So one over something is just that something to the
negative one power.
And then I multiplied the exponents.
You can think of it that way and so this would be equal
the same bases, ten in this case, and you 're dividing them,
you just take the one the numerator and you subtract the
exponent in the denominator.
So it 's eleven minus minus six, which is eleven plus six,
which is equal to seventeen.
So this division problem ended up being equal to
0. 5 times 10 to the 17th.
Which is the correct answer, but if you wanted to be a
stickler and put it into scientific notation, we want
something maybe greater than one right here.
So the way we can do that, let 's multiply
it by ten on this side.
And divide by ten on this side or multiply by one / ten.
Remember, we 're not changing the number if you multiply
by ten and divide by ten.
We 're just doing it to different parts of the product.
So this side is going to become five - - I 'll do it in pink - - ten
times 0. 5 is 5, times 10 to the 17th divided by 10.
That 's the same thing as ten to the seventeenth times ten
to the minus one, right?
That 's ten to the minus one.
So it 's equal to ten to the sixteenth power.
Which is the answer when you divide these two
guys right there.
So hopefully these examples have filled in all of the
gaps or the uncertain scenarios dealing with
scientific notation.
If I haven 't covered something, feel free to write a comment on
this video or pop me an e - mail.

Let 's think about it for a little bit, you' ll see there is really only two possibilities.
If we 're trying to find the shortest path from I to J that is allowed to use K
and any of the nodes with numbers smaller than K.
There are two possibilities. It may be that we don 't need to use K at all for the smallest path.
We just follow path from I to J only using nodes who have values less than K
or we go and visit K and then we go from K to J,
but in visiting K, we don 't ever need to visit K on the way to K that wouldn' t be a very good path.
The shortest path from I to K only using nodes that are less than K
then we follow another path now from K to J only using nodes whose numbers are less than K.
Those are the only things that could happen. We don 't want to visit K twice.
We 're not allowed to use any nodes that are greater than K
those are the two possibilities and whichever one of these two things is shortest.
The shortest path from I to K followed by the shortest path from K to J
or the shortest path from I to J whichever those two things are shortest,
is the shortest path from I to J possibly using K and things less than K.
We can just write that in a straightforward way
by taking advantage of the fact that someone has given us the K,
not tooth decay but matrix decay.
The length of the shortest path from I to K using only those less than K, we have that already.
Someone gave it to us very helpfully.
All we need to do is compare the distance of I to J not using K
and the distance from I to K not using K and K to J not using K.
It 's weird, but it' s the right thing to do.
We can take advantage of this insight to actually create an efficient algorithm
We can initialize D⁰ so this is the length of the shortest path from I to J
using nodes only numbered less than zero which is to say no intermediate node,
but that 's just the direct cost of going from I to J.
From the cost in our graph, we can fill in this matrix.
And once we have D⁰ initialize, we can run K from 0 to n - 1
and for each pair of I and J, take Dk + 1 to be the smaller of D⁰ [k, i,, j]
and D⁰ [k, i, k} and D⁰ [k, i, j] add it together just as I was describing before.
When this is all over, when this loop is done, we have the D⁰n,
but D⁰ [n, i, j} is the length of the shortest from I to J
only hopping on nodes that are numbered less than n, but that 's all the nodes.
All the nodes are numbered less than n.
They are all numbered from 0 to n - 1.
so this is the length of the shortest path from I to J, unrestricted, full stop.
so that 's pretty cool, and if you think about what' s going on here,
this initialization step runs over all pairs of nodes so that 's n².
This loop runs over all pairs of nodes n², but it does this from each value from 0 to n - 1.
So altogether we 're talking about n * n² or n³.
This better than the n3 / logn we get by applying repeat Dijkstra to a dense graph.
So for a dense graph, you 're better off using Floyd - Warshall n³ instead of the n³ / logn.
Log n is often not that huge a number so your mileage may vary.
so you can actually try the overhead, but boy it 's hard to imagine having less overhead than this
It is very straightforward it runs through the n³ possibilities,
and in fact, if we do this carefully, we don 't need to keep a separate D matrix for each of this cases.
You can actually do these updates completely in place so the storage is pretty low too.

For this question, we want you to implement mark _ component
using the open list as discussed in lecture.
This means that mark _ component should not use recursion.

There 's another way to look at this types of value propositions, kind of as a Venn diagram.
What comes from technical insights are making things more efficient
or smaller or faster and sometimes lower cost and simpler.
What comes from market insights are better distribution and bundling and branding.
But sometimes what you have is this sweet spot in the middle
that actually is a combination of technical and market insights
that makes for a killer value proposition.

Now, the next market type is a new market. Customers don 't exist today.
As the real questions are, if they don 't exist, how will they find out about you?
And how will they even become aware that they need to be in this new market?
And by the way, how do you know the market size of something that doesn 't even exist today?
The market size is zero and what factors should you create that the industry has never offered.
Now, a way to look at this is take a look at the chasm.
Man, this is scary. That is you can sell to the crazy people all you want.
The early evangelists, the early adopters, and that 's nice but you' ll have a small business
until you figure out how do we get the masses to adopt?
and here 's what that hockey stick sales curve looks like.
Here are the early people you 're selling to and one of the mistakes
that start - ups and entrepreneurs and founders make, is look at that slope of those early sales,
and when you get them, you go great time to like kick up spending
and look at this, our board is happy and when we start doing advertising
and stepping up the company, but then it kind of declines
and people scratch their heads on what 's going on.
What 's going on is the mainstream market just hasn' t adopted and this might go on for years
and never kick in but if you 're lucky, you' ll hit a tipping point and market adoption happens.
And when it happens, it happens faster than you could imagine
but at times, it takes longer to get there than you could imagine.
So in a new market, one of the things you need to be thinking about is that,
is there any possible way to move this curve in?
There 's a couple of really interesting things to notice about in a new market.
One is this value of debt of almost no sales can continue for years.
Now, why is this important to know?
Well, just imagine you 're a start - up and you put together a nice financial forecast
for your board and your investors and they all believe that you are an existing market.
So, they 're expecting you to have revenue that increases every year.
Why? Because you 've never asked the question what type of market am I in?
Now, if you 're in a new market, you now know that it' s quite possible that you might have a curve
that doesn 't look like this but actually is flat for a long period of time.

Let 's take a look at value proposition.
Value proposition is not something you 're building in isolation.
While the value proposition is about solving a customer problem or need,
it really consists of 3 components.
The easy one for most entrepreneurs to talk about is what product features you have
or what product services you 're providing.
But there 's actually 2 more important components to value proposition:
What gain are you creating for customers?
And what pain are you solving for them?
Alexander Osterwalder, when he drew the business model canvas,
really emphasized this. It 's not just about your product.
And especially if you come from a technical background, it 's really easy to say,
"Oh, look at all these features."
And if you find yourself doing that, you need to complete the sentence and say,
"Yes, but here 's what we make people be able to do better,
"and here are the problems we solve for them."
So the real goal of you figuring out the value proposition
is understanding what we call the minimal viable product.
You 're trying to figure out, "Now that I kind of understand my product and service
"and what I 'm gaining for customers and the pain I' m solving,
"what 's the smallest possible feature set I could be shipping on day 1
"that solves these pains and creates gains for them?"
And this really is an interactive process
because there is no way, no possible way, sitting in your office you could figure this out.
And the default for great engineers and great entrepreneurs is,
"Oh, I understand customers' problems and needs,
"so don 't worry about it. We' ll just spec the entire product on day 1."
Your real goal here is to figure out what 's the smallest thing you could build and develop
that actually gets you users or sales or whatever
and get out to market as quickly as possible.
And so the goal of you getting out of the building for value proposition
is understanding gains and pains so you can figure out what 's the MVP,
or minimum viable product.

Let 's tackle a slightly harder problem than what
we saw in the last video.
I have here x minus 3 over x plus 4 is greater
than or equal to 2.
So the reason why this is slightly harder is I now have
a greater than or equal to.
And the other thing that makes it slightly harder is I don 't
just have a simple 0 here, I actually have a 2 here.
So I 'm going to do this problem the same way.
I 'm going to do it two ways.
I 'm going to do the same two ways we did last time, but I' m
going to reverse the order of the two ways that I do it.
So the first thing I can do, I might be tempted - - let me
multiply both sides of this equation times x plus 4.
And like we saw in the last video we had to be very
careful because we have an inequality here.
If x plus 4 is greater than 0 then we 're going to keep
If it 's less than 0 we' re going to swap it.
So let 's look at those two situations.
So one situation is - - let me make it right here.
One situation is x plus 4 is greater then 0.
And remember, it can ever be equal to 0 because then this
expression would be undefined.
So let 's explore x plus 4 is greater than 0.
If we subtract 4 from both sides of this equation this is
equivalent to saying - - these are equivalent statements.
If we subtract 4 from both sides that x is
greater than minus 4.
So if we assume that x is greater than minus 4 then
x plus 4 is going to be greater than 0.
And then when we multiply both sides of this times
x minus 3 over x plus 4.
You have your 2.
We 're going to multiply both sides of this times x plus 4.
Since we 're assuming x is greater than minus 4 or that x
plus 4 is greater than 0, we don 't have to switch
the inequality sign.
We 're multiplying both sides by a positive.
So the inequality stays the same as in our
original problem.
And the whole reason why we did that is because this
and this will cancel out.
And then we have 2 times x plus 4.
Let 's see what we get.
x minus 3 is greater than or equal to 2 times x plus
2 times 4, which is 8.
And now what can we do?
We can subtract x from both sides.
We get minus 3 is greater than or equal to x plus 8.
I just took x from 2x.
And then we can subtract 8 from both sides.
So you subtract 8 from both sides.
You get minus 3 minus 8 is minus 11 is greater
than or equal to x.
And of course, then we subtract an 8 so this guy disappears.
So if we assume that x is greater than minus 4, then
x has to be less than or equal to minus 11.
Now that seems a little bit nonsensical.
In order for this statement to be true, x has to be both
greater than minus 4 and it has to be less than minus 11.
Anything greater than minus 4 is going to be
greater than minus 11.
So there 's no x that satisfies this equation.
So if we assume that x plus 4 is greater than 0, we just end
up with a nonsensical solution.
So we can actually ignore that path.
There 's no situation in which x plus 4 is going to be greater
than 0 and we 're going to actually have a solution
to this equation.
So let 's assume what happens when x plus 4 is less than 0.
I 'll do it here.
So what happens when x plus 4 is less than 0?
And once again, that 's an equivalent statement.
If we subtract 4 from both sides of this equation
to saying that x is less than minus 4.
These are equivalent statements.
So if we assume that x is less than minus 4, then when we
multiply both sides of this equation times x plus 4 and
you 're multiplying it by x minus 3 over x plus 4.
And you have your 2 and you 're multiplying
that times x plus 4.
Since we 're taking the other situation where x is less than
minus 4, which makes this expression negative - - since
we 're multiplying both sides of the equation by a negative, we
swap the inequality just like that.
And let 's see what we get.
This and this cancel out.
And then we get x minus 3 is less than or equal to 2 times
x plus 2 times 4, which is 8.
And we do the same algebra.
Let 's subtract x from both sides.
We get minus 3 is less than or equal to x plus 8.
If we subtract 8 from both sides we get minus 11 is
If we assume this is negative, we get x has
to be less than minus 4.
If x is less than minus 4, in order for this equation to
hold up, x also has to be greater than minus 11.
And this is actually possible.
You can have an x, so x has to be - - we can rewrite
this - - greater than or equal to minus 11.
I just swapped the two sides.
And x has to be less than minus 4.
And there are x 's that satisfy these two constraints.
There weren 't x' s that satisfy these two constraints.
Nothing satisfies both of these, but there are things
that satisfy both of these.
For example, minus 5.
Let 's draw this on the number line.
Let 's draw a solution to this problem.
Let me keep the problem there.
If I draw a number line, I want to switch colors.
So we have minus 11.
We can be greater than or equal to minus 11.
So this is minus 11.
would make this undefined.
So we have to be less than minus 4, so we don 't
include minus 4.
We 're less than minus 4, but we have to be greater
than or equal to 11.
So we can 't go less than 11, but we include the 11
because this is greater than or equal to.
So anything in this, where I 've shaded it in - - anything on this
range will satisfy that equation over there.
Now let 's do it the other way.
Let 's do it where we - - the numerator and denominator
both have to be positive or negative.
Let 's see if we can do the same problem that way.
So let me rewrite it down here, maybe in a new color.
So the same problem.
x minus 3 over x plus 4 is greater than or equal to 2.
Now, in order to do that reasoning that I did in the
first video, remember the first video I said, well, it 's a
divided by b is greater than 0.
Either both of these are positive or both of
these are negative.
But this only worked when we had a 0 over here.
But we don 't have a 0 here we have a 2 so we can' t at least
immediately do that rationale.
But maybe we can if we subtract 2 from both
sides of this equation.
So let 's do that.
So you have x minus 3 over x plus 4 minus 2 is greater
than or equal to 0.
Just subtract a 2 from both sides.
I can add or subtract without messing up the inequality.
Never have to worry about that.
It 's only when you multiply by negatives that you
swap the inequality.
And now, what is this?
You know, this doesn 't look like a rational expression.
But I can rewrite minus 2, right?
Minus 2 is the same thing as minus 2 times x
plus 4 over x plus 4.
This is minus 2 times 1.
This is the same thing.
And this is the same thing as minus 2x plus - -
let me be careful.
This is the same thing as minus 2x minus 8 over x plus 4.
This right here is the exact same thing as minus 2.
I just multiply it times x plus 4 for x plus 4.
Let 's write it this way because then we can add them.
So if we write that way, so I have x minus 3 over x plus 4.
And I wrote it that way so I have a common denominator.
And then I have plus minus 2x minus 8 over x plus
4 is greater than 0.
I have a common denominator.
That was my whole point of doing this.
And so I have a denominator of x plus 4 and then when you add
these two things you get x minus 2x.
That 's a minus x.
And then you have minus 3 minus 8 - - that 's minus
11 - - is greater than 0.
So now I simplify the problem into something like this.
So there 's two situations.
Oh, let me be very careful.
This was greater than or equal.
This must be greater than or equal.
Don 't want to lose that little equal sign.
That was the whole point of this problem.
So now I 'm ready to operate just like this.
Actually, before I even do this, let 's get one
thing out of the way.
Let 's be very clear.
x can never be equal to minus 4.
Because if x is equal to minus 4, this whole statement - - that
original problem is undefined.
So let 's just write that first.
You know, we could have written that from the get - go.
x cannot be equal to minus 4, for any solution.
That will make this expression undefined.
Now, we have this and we saw in the first video and we saw
right there that there 's two situations.
Either both of these are positive.
So they 're either both positive, so minus x minus 11
is greater than or equal to 0.
This could be equal to 0.
Actually, if this is equal to 0, then this whole
thing is going to be true.
So either that is greater than or equal to 0 and this right
here is greater than 0.
It can 't be equal to 0.
And x plus 4 is greater than 0.
That 's the situation where both of them are positive.
Or they 're both going to be less than 0.
And I 'm running out of space.
Or minus x minus 11 is less than or equal to 0.
And - - I 'll write and like that.
And x plus 4 is less than 0.
Remember, it can 't ever equal 0.
So they 're either both positive or both negative.
That 's the only way they we' re going to get something.
Well, the numerator can be equal to 0 because this
thing can equal 0.
Or they 're both positive to get something positive.
Or they 're both negative, so that when you divide a negative
by a negative you still get something positive.
So let 's look at these two situations and see if we get
any solutions that make sense.
So right here, if we add x to both sides of this equation we
get minus 11 is greater than or equal to x.
Or another way you could say it, is x is less than
or equal to minus 11.
I just swapped these two sides.
And then here, if we add minus 4 - - if we subtract 4 from
both sides we get x is greater than minus 4.
But once again, this makes no sense.
There 's no way that I can have - - remember
there 's an and here.
Both of these have to be true.
There 's no x that is greater than minus 4
and less than minus 11.
So this right here, there 's no constraints.
So both of these can never be - - both the numerator and the
denominator can never both be positive at the same time
because in order for them both to be positive you get an
impossible constraint to fill.
So let 's look at the situation.
The other situation is when they are both negative.
When both this numerator and this denominator
are both negative.
Let me be clear.
You can 't make a statement about these two not
being positive.
These two things can ever be positive.
Remember, because we had to get the 0 here in order to use
this logic to begin with.
So the fact that when we tried to figure out x 's that would
make both of these positive, we got a nonsensical, impossible
to fill constraint, tells me that both this numerator and
this denominator can never both be positive for any given x.
Now let 's see if they can both be negative.
So for both of them to be negative or the numerator
could also be equal to 0.
If we add x to both sides of this we get minus 11 is
less than or equal to x.
Or we could say that x is greater than or equal to minus
11 just swapping around.
And - - and this is an and.
So x has to be greater than or equal to minus 11 or less than
minus 4, which is exactly what we came up in the last problem.
I can draw the number line again.
We have to be greater than or equal to minus 11.
So that 's minus 11 there.
We could be equal to it or greater than, but we have
to be less than minus 4.
undefined or our whole equation undefined.
It will make our denominator 0.
And so this is our solution set.
Anything right here that I 've shaded in, including minus 11,
but not including minus 4.
So if you could get this problem I think you can handle
pretty much any rational equation problem.
Hope you enjoyed that.

It 's sort of cool that Top K via partitioning as just described works.
It gets us the Top K values in a not sorted order.
Right. Let 's do an analysis of the time it takes for a Top K to do its work via this partitioning approach.
And because it 's recursive algorithm, it' s going to help to set this up in terms of recurrence relations.
Here 's the recurrence relation we want to solve.
The time it takes to run Top K via partitioning on one element.
Let 's call that 1, and the time that it takes to run an n element
is going to be hard to write down exactly but we can put down a bound. So what does it do?
First, it does the partitioning operation, which runs through all the elements of the list
that takes time n and then it 's going to recurse assuming it hasn' t gotten really lucky
and since this is a less than or equal to let 's assume it didn' t get lucky.
It 's going to recurse on either the left or the right.
Now, the partitioning algorithm is going to split this list L into a left and a right.
In different cases, it 's going to recurse on either the left or the right.
But we don 't know which one it' s going to recurse on and we don 't know which one is bigger.
What do we know? Well, it 's just as likely for the left to be bigger
as it is for the right to be bigger and vice versa.
Really you can imagine with justification that with probability of half
the left side is bigger and in particular bigger than size n / 2
and in half the cases right is bigger and again bigger meaning it 's going to be at least size n / 2.
If the recursive algorithm gets called on the smaller half
then the work that it has to do is whatever the recursive running time is on at least of size n / 2
or smaller as this is an upper bound and that happens with the probability of half
but we might also get unlucky and have to recurse on the larger half,
which could involve actually something almost the size of the entire list.
It 's kind of a weird recurrence relation because it has probabilities in it
but really we want a bound on the running time.
How many steps it 's going to take in this case on average for Top K to finish each stop.
I mean this gives us an upper bound. This recurrence relation gives us an upper bound.
All right so to solve this recurrence relation, I 'm going to cheat a little bit
because I know that 4n is going to be a good upper bound on the value of T (n).
All we have to do is actually prove that that 's true. We don' t actually have to figure it out.
To prove that this is true we 're going to proceed by induction.
Our base case is T (1) = 1, which is indeed less than or equal to 4.
For inductive step, we know from the structure of the algorithm
that the time it takes to handle an input of size n is on average going to be
less than or equal to n + 1 / 2T (n / 2) + 1 / 2T (n) just like we argued before.
And now we 're going to use our inductive hypothesis that T (n) â¤ 4n
to get an upper bound on this quantity.
T (n / 2) we 're assuming is upper bounded by 4n / 2, which is 2n,
and this quantity T (n) we 're assuming is less than 4n.
Now this is a little bit of a mathematical abuse of induction.
We really don 't want this to be n here because our inductive step is going to assume this
true for everything smaller than n and not equal to n
but the reality is this is actually a tiny little bit less than n.
The worst possible case that you get in this algorithm is we pick the partition on the n,
and then we recurse on everything but the n.
There 's t (n - 1) here but it' s - - with apologies, you can make these
details all work out but it 's a little irritating.
With that caveat, we proceed. What we have is this is equal to n + n + 2n, which is indeed 4n.
We 've now shown that for each value of n, T (n) is always upper bounded by 4n.
And that 's what we wanted to show, but this is pretty remarkable.
Because what that means is we actually find the Top K elements in Î (n).
You know 4n is Î (n) so the running time is going to be linear, which is pretty neat.

Several statistics we can compute in a pretty straightforward way if the list L is sorted.
Let 's imagine that these are list of values that we' re concerned about and I put little
pointy things on it to say that this is now sorted from smallest to largest.
If this L is sorted the minimum value is sitting here in the very first position - - so it 's L (â),
the maximum is sitting all the way at the end here - - L (n - â),
midpoint is just the average of those two - - so we can look up the minimum, the maximum
add them together and divided by 2, and the median is just whoever is
sitting in the middle of this list once it 's sorted.
In this case, all of these operations run in Î (1) constant time, given that the list is sorted.
Things like the mean or the mode aren 't quite so straightforward to do on a sorted
list like this but these four we can do very, very quickly.
Just to practice this idea, here 's little quiztistics. Here' s a sorted list of two digit numbers.
I want you to find the midpoint and the median of this list
and then tell me what 's the mean of those two values.
You can write it in this box.

Determine whether 30 / 45 and 54 / 81
are equivalent fractions.
Well, the easiest way I can think of doing this is to put
both of these fractions into lowest possible terms, and
then if they 're the same fraction, then they' re
So 30 / 45, what 's the largest factor of both 30 and 45?
15 will go into 30.
It 'll also go into 45.
So this is the same thing.
30 is 2 times 15 and 45 is 3 times 15.
So we can divide both the numerator and the
denominator by 15.
So if we divide both the numerator and the denominator
by 15, what happens?
Well, this 15 divided by 15, they cancel out, this 15
divided by 15 cancel out, and we 'll just be left with 2 / 3.
So 30 / 45 is the same thing as 2 / 3.
It 's equivalent to 2 / 3.
2 / 3 is in lowest possible terms, or simplified form,
however you want to think about it.
Now, let 's try to do 54 / 81.
Now, let 's see.
Nothing really jumps out at me.
Let 's see, 9 is divisible into both of these.
We could write 54 as being 6 times 9, and 81 is the same
thing as 9 times 9.
You can divide the numerator and the denominator by 9.
So we could divide both of them by 9.
9 divided by 9 is 1, 9 divided by 9 is 1, so we get this as
being equal to 6 / 9.
Now, let 's see.
6 is the same thing as 2 times 3.
9 is the same thing as 3 times 3.
We could just cancel these 3 's out, or you could imagine this
is the same thing as dividing both the numerator and the
denominator by 3, or multiplying both the numerator
These are all equivalent.
I could write divide by 3 or multiply by 1 / 3.
Actually, let me write divide by 3.
Let me write divide by 3 for now.
I don 't want to assume you know how to multiply
fractions, because we 're going to learn that in the future.
So we 're going to divide by 3.
3 divided by 3 is just 1.
3 divided by 3 is 1, and you 're left with 2 / 3.
So both of these fractions, when you simplify them, when
you put them in simplified form, both end up being 2 / 3,
so they are equivalent fractions.

Let 's try to do this in a general way now. Right. So we call this procedure down heapify.
Let 's talk about how we actually will go with this.
I 've made a couple of helpful routines to help with the heap.
given a position i in the heap, left (i) returns the position of the left child.
Right (i) returns the position of the right child. Parent (i) returns the position of the parent.
Root (i) answers whether or not the node that we 're talking about is a root.
There 's no root. Leaf (L, i) returns whether or not we' re looking at a leaf (i).
In other words, it has no children.
It has no children if what where the right child would be is off the end of the list
and where the left child would be is off the end of the list.
Then there 's one other special kind of node and there can be at most
one of these in the whole tree and that 's a one _ child node.
That happens if a node has a left child, which is the very last element in the array.
The right child doesn 't exist.
That 's just what I said that the right child is at the very end of the list
or off the end of the list then that 's a one _ child node.
Down heapify is this notion that we 've got.
We apply this in the notion where we 've got a heap rooted at node i that satisfies
the heap property except perhaps i to its children, to its immediate children.
We can apply this if the heap property is satisfied.
Everywhere except maybe between the root and its kids,
so the root in particular the node i and its kids.
Let 's just say that. If i is actually a leaf, then we' re done. Right.
We 're satisfied everywhere except for between i and its children,
and i doesn 't have any children.
So, good. That 's great. Heap property is restored.
If i has only one child, then we need to think a little harder.
In the case where i has one child, we check the heap property
between i and its one child on the left and if i is bigger than its child that 's bad.
That means the heap property isn 't satisfied but all we have to do to fix it is
we just swap the value in the left child and i.
That 's what we did and then now we know that that last node
is the very last node in the tree and that node we just swapped into
is the very last node in the tree so it must be that things are happy everywhere.
What if i has two children? So this is some internal node in the tree now.
Or possibly a root of a large tree. So now we check the heap property.
I 'm going to do this this way. I' m going to ask look at the left and the right children,
and look at the minimum value of those two.
If the minimum value is bigger than or equal to L [i] that means L [i]
the value at node i is smaller than both the kids so we 're good.
The heap property is satisfied everywhere and we can just return.
On the other hand, sadly if that doesn 't hold, then we need to see which child is the smallest
or the smaller of the two and swap i 's value into that child.
That 's just what we' re doing in the example by hand.
Let 's check it. If the left child is smaller than the right child,
that means that the left child is the smallest one.
We swap i and the left child 's value and then we need to down heapify on the left child.
We 've basically fixed things everywhere except for possibly the tree rooted at left (i).
It could actually not satisfy the heap property but that 's okay.
We can fix that by bubbling down the tree with down heapify once again.
It 's just what we did when we' re doing it by hand and then we can return.
Finally, we reached this point, if the heap property is violated and the right child of i
is between i and the right child of i so we can just swap i and the right child of i
possibly causing the tree rooted at the right child of i to be violated.
We just run down heapify starting from there. When that 's done, we can return.
And we 've established the heap property throughout the tree.

Most of what we do early on when we first learn about
calculus is to use limits.
We use limits to figure out derivatives of functions.
the notion of a limit.
It 's a slope around the point as we take the limit of
points closer and closer to the point in question.
And you 've seen that many, many, many times over.
In this video I guess we 're going to do it in the
opposite direction.
We 're going to use derivatives to figure out limits.
And in particular, limits that end up in indeterminate form.
And when I say by indeterminate form I mean that when we just
take the limit as it is, we end up with something like 0 / 0, or
infinity over infinity, or negative infinity over
infinity, or maybe negative infinity over negative
infinity, or positive infinity over negative infinity.
All of these are indeterminate, undefined forms.
And to do that we 're going to use l' Hopital 's rule.
l 'Hoptial' s rule says and how to apply it because it 's fairly
straightforward, and it 's actually a very useful tool
sometimes if you 're in some type of a math competition and
they ask you to find a difficult limit that when you
just plug the numbers in you get something like this.
L 'Hopital' s rule is normally what they are testing you for.
And in a future video I might prove it, but that gets a
little bit more involved.
The application is actually reasonably straightforward.
So what l 'Hopital' s rule tells us that if we have - - and I 'll
do it in abstract form first, but I think when I show you
the example it will all be made clear.
That if the limit as x roaches c of f of x is equal to 0, and
the limit as x approaches c of g of x is equal to 0, and - - and
this is another and - - and the limit as x approaches c of f
prime of x over g prime of x exists and it equals L.
then - - so all of these conditions have to be met.
This is the indeterminate form of 0 / 0, so this
is the first case.
Then we can say that the limit as x approaches c of
f of x over g of x is also going to be equal to L.
So this might seem a little bit bizarre to you right now, and
I 'm actually going to write the other case, and then
I 'll do an example.
We 'll do multiple examples and the examples are going
to make it all clear.
So this is the first case and the example we 're going to
do is actually going to be an example of this case.
Now the other case is if the limit as x approaches c of f of
x is equal to positive or negative infinity, and the
limit as x approaches c of g of x is equal to positive or
negative infinity, and the limit of I guess you could say
the quotient of the derivatives exists, and the limit as x
approaches c of f prime of x over g prime of x
is equal to L.
Then we can make this same statement again.
Let me just copy that out.
Edit, copy, and then let me paste it.
So in either of these two situations just to kind of make
sure you understand what you 're looking at, this is the
situation where if you just tried to evaluate this limit
right here you 're going to get f of c, which is 0.
Or the limit as x approaches c of f of x over the limit as
x approaches c of g of x.
That 's going to give you 0 / 0.
And so you say, hey, I don 't know what that limit is?
But this says, well, look.
If this limit exists, I could take the derivative of each
of these functions and then try to evaluate that limit.
And if I get a number, if that exists, then they 're going
to be the same limit.
This is a situation where when we take the limit we get
infinity over infinity, or negative infinity or positive
infinity over positive or negative infinity.
So these are the two indeterminate forms.
And to make it all clear let me just show you an example
because I think this will make things a lot more clear.
So let 's say we are trying to find the limit - - I' ll
do this in a new color.
Let me do it in this purplish color.
Let 's say we wanted to find the limit as x approaches
0 of sine of x over x.
Now if we just view this, if we just try to evaluate it at 0 or
take the limit as we approach 0 in each of these functions,
we 're going to get something that looks like 0 / 0.
Sine of 0 is 0.
Or the limit as x approaches 0 of sine of x is 0.
And obviously, as x approaches 0 of x, that 's also
going to be 0.
So this is our indeterminate form.
And if you want to think about it, this is our f of x, that
f of x right there is the sine of x.
And our g of x, this g of x right there for this
first case, is the x.
g of x is equal to x and f of x is equal to sine of x.
And notice, well, we definitely know that this meets the
first two constraints.
The limit as x, and in this case, c is 0.
The limit as x approaches 0 of sine of sine of x is 0, and
the limit as x approaches 0 of x is also equal to 0.
So we get our indeterminate form.
So let 's see, at least, whether this limit even exists.
If we take the derivative of f of x and we put that over the
derivative of g of x, and take the limit as x approaches 0
in this case, that 's our c.
Let 's see if this limit exists.
So I 'll do that in the blue.
So let me write the derivatives of the two functions.
So f prime of x.
If f of x is sine of x, what 's f prime of x?
Well, it 's just cosine of x.
You 've learned that many times.
And if g of x is x, what is g prime of x?
That 's super easy.
The derivative of x is just 1.
Let 's try to take the limit as x approaches 0 of f prime of x
over g prime of x - - over their derivatives.
So that 's going to be the limit as x approaches 0
of cosine of x over 1.
I wrote that 1 a little strange.
And this is pretty straightforward.
What is this going to be?
Well, as x approaches 0 of cosine of x, that 's
going to be equal to 1.
And obviously, the limit as x approaches 0 of 1, that 's
also going to be equal to 1.
So in this situation we just saw that the limit as x
approaches - - our c in this case is 0.
As x approaches 0 of f prime of x over g prime
of x is equal to 1.
This limit exists and it equals 1, so we 've met
all of the conditions.
This is the case we 're dealing with.
Limit as x approaches 0 of sine of x is equal to 0.
Limit as z approaches 0 of x is also equal to 0.
The limit of the derivative of sine of x over the derivative
of x, which is cosine of x over 1 - - we found this
to be equal to 1.
All of these top conditions are met, so then we know
this must be the case.
That the limit as x approaches 0 of sine of x over x
must be equal to 1.
It must be the same limit as this value right here where we
take the derivative of the f of x and of the g of x.
I 'll do more examples in the next few videos and I think

Now, in summary, revenue streams
might take the form of a whole series of potential strategies.
But what 's interesting is inside of each revenue stream,
you may have different pricing tactics.
Let me say that again.
We just talked about revenue streams.
If you think about it, we didn 't talk about how much to charge.
We talked about the potential ways to charge—
licensing and intermediation and direct sales, etc.
But how do you think about pricing itself?
How do you set prices?
Let 's take a look.
Pricing is kind of the tactics.
The first thing you have to figure out is what 's the revenue stream
I 'm going to use for the customer segment.
But there are two types of prices.
One is fixed prices.
Fixed pricing is just like it sounds.
There 's no haggling.
Here 's how it is. It' s the fixed price.
Now, fixed price you can decide, well, how do I set that price.
I 'm going to take the cost of what it takes me to build the product,
and I 'm going to add some fixed markup—whatever I think my profit should be.
It 's very simple. It' s cost plus markup.
This gets me to the minimum price in the market.
But you know what? I might know something that my competitors don 't know.
Because I 've been out talking to these customers for weeks or months,
and I know that they actually value my feature set, my value proposition,
more than my competitor 's.
In an existing market, I will likely know something no one knows.
I know exactly how much they value what I will offer.
Instead of pricing based on cost,
I could actually price on specific customer segments
or on features I know they need.
There 's a third type of fixed pricing, and that' s called "volume pricing."
It might be that you want to encourage high volume,
because you have economies of scale.
So, you might price the product if you buy in quantities of 1 - 10 it 's $1000,
but if you buy in quantities of 10 - 100 it 's $900.
Therefore, you can keep stepping up the discount,
but if you buy in hundreds of thousands or millions,
instead of $1000 we 'll charge $99.
Know who does that?
Go talk to Intel and the semiconductor manufacturers.
They want to encourage high - volume purchases,
and so they have stepped pricing that is oriented to create volume.
Cost plus market, value pricing, and volume price
are all examples of fixed pricing tactics.
But there 's another type of pricing.
That 's dynamic pricing.
Dynamic pricing is exactly what it sounds like.
Dynamic means it moves.
How could you have prices that kind of move?
I thought all pricing is written down on a piece of paper and never changes.
If you ever think about it,
pricing that you negotiate—yeah, we kind of have this price on paper,
but that 's just the starting point of the conversation.
Negotiated prices is a dynamic price.
But airlines are now a great example of another type of dynamic pricing,
and that 's called "yield management."
If you think about it, once an airplane takes off they can no longer sell those seats.
So, a month before the flight, those seats might be $500. 00.
A week before, those seats might actually go up to $600. 00.
An hour before, those seats might drop down to $99. 00,
because that plan is leaving, and if we have empty seats, we 're not getting any revenue.
So, yield management is actually pretty interesting based on experience, on time, etc.
There are software programs and industries like airlines and car rentals, etc,
that have perishable seats or time actually are quite good at doing this.
Another type of dynamic pricing is real - time markets.
The stock market is a real - time market.
Then auctions like eBay are another example of dynamic pricing.
Again, two types of pricing models—fixed and dynamic.
How do you know which one to use?
You 've been out talking to customers.
How do they currently buy and what 's the revenue stream
that 's associated with these kind of pricing tactics?
You need to be constantly thinking what 's the right revenue stream
for the right segment and, within that, what 's the right pricing model.
Is it fixed or is it dynamic, and which one are you going to pick?

Some of the revenue model questions:
What is it my customers are paying for?
What 's the value? What is it when they look at my company and my products?
By the way, what capacity do they have to pay? They might love it.
In fact, everybody who looks at a Ferrari or a Tesla model S
might say, yes, I 'd love to pay for that, but—you know what? —my wife won' t let me
or I just don 't have the money.
That is, is the total available market of potential users your needs for revenue?
You might have built a product so expensive
that the customer segment you 've targeted just can' t afford it.
Then how will you package your product?
By package I don 't mean what kind of pretty box is it in.
Another mistake startups make, particularly engineering - driven startups,
is putting every possible feature into the first product,
not thinking that perhaps—well, wait a minute.
Maybe we could decompose the product—that is, take it apart—
and offer these as add - ons or as ancillary products
or separate products, etc.
How you package your products should not just be an engineering functionality decision.
It should be a value - based decision.
As we said, the same with pricing.
How will you price? What kind of tactics will you use?

The last piece I want to talk about for research is intellectualy property.
There are great law firms who can give you tutorials.
There is plenty of stuff on the web.
But the types of intellectual property, shorthand IP, you want to think about are these.
There are 5. One is trademark.
Trademark means what can you protect as branding. Like the Nike swoosh.
The examples could be marks or logos or slogans.
Other type of intellectual property could be copyright.
An example is creative or authored works and expressions.
You can 't copyright ideas, but you can copyright software or songs or movies or website content.
The other one is trade secrets.
Well I don 't want to patent this because someone is going to read the patent.
They 'll figure it out.
So you might have decided that you 're going to protect it in a vault.
Just like the Coca Cola recipe is supposedly kept in a vault in Atlanta,
and it 's non - public technology.
Also your customer lists might kind of fit in this category,
or some secret formulas necessary for our final element in your product.
Two things that startups run into all of the time are contracts or NDAs,
which stands for non - disclosure agreements.
You know what 's protectable is in the contract, that is you specify it or somebody making
you sign it or offering you a contract or an NDA specifies it.
Examples are technology and business information.
By the way before we go forward, this is one point I want to mention.
Founders sometimes naively believe that they can protect their technology from investors
or potential investors by making investors sign a non - disclosure agreement.
That just doesn 't happen, and it' s a naive view of how to protect your technology.
My suggestion is, by the way, don 't put your source code, your firmware, or your deep insight
in the first presentation.
Because you 're never going to have somebody push a bag of money at you across the table
over a series of Powerpoint slides.
In fact if an investor is interested, and you are now in meeting 2, 3, or 4, and they say listen
for us to really proceed we need to have you open the hood and let us or a consultant
take a look, the next question to ask is well if we do that, and it meets these following criteria,
is there an investment or not?
If the answer is yes then you can make them, or at least require an NDA, because they have
gone down the path of interest with you and are serious.
The last piece of intellectual property is patent.
U. S. patent law has changed in some important ways in the last year.
If you were familiar with it it 's nice to get updated with it again.
What 's protectable are inventions.
Typical examples are new technologies.
You 've invented something new. Some hardware, or algorithm, or software, etc.
Getting a patent is kind of important.


Find all of the factors of 120.
Or another way to think about it, find all of the whole
numbers that 120 is divisible by.
So the first one, that 's maybe obvious.
All whole numbers are divisible by 1.
So we could write 120 is equal to is to 1 times 120.
So let 's write a factors list over here.

So this is going to be our factors list over here.
So we just found two factors.
We said, well, is it divisible by 1?
Well, every whole number is divisible by 1.
This is a whole number, so 1 is a factor at the low end.
1 is a factor.
That 's its actual smallest factor, and its
largest factor is 120.
You can 't have something larger than 120 dividing
evenly into 120.
121 will not go into 120.
So the largest factor on our factors list
is going to be 120.
Now let 's think about others.
Let 's think about whether is 2 divisible into 120?
So there 's 120 equals 2 times something?
Well, when you look here, maybe you immediately
recognize that 120 is an even number.
It 's ones place is a 0.
As as long as its ones place is a 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, as long
as it 's an even number, the whole number is even and the
whole number is divisible by 2.
And to figure out what you have to multiply by 2 to get
120, well, you can think of 120 as 12 times 10, or another
way to think about it, it 's 2 times 6 times
10, or 2 times 60.
You could divide it out if you want.
You could say, OK, 2 goes into 120.
2 goes into 1 no times.
2 goes into 12 six times.
6 times 2 is 12.
Subtract.
You get 0.
Bring down the 0.
2 goes into 0 zero times.
0 times 2 is 0, and you get no remainder there, so it goes
sixty times.
So we have two more factors right here.
So we have the factors.
So we 've established the next lowest one is 2, and the next
highest factor, if we 're starting from the large end,
is going to be 60.
Now let 's think about three.
Is 120 equal to 3 times something?
Well, we could just try to test and divide it from the
get go, but hopefully, you already know the
divisibility rule.
To figure out if something is divisible by 3, you add up its
digits, and if the sum is divisible
by 3, we 're in business.
So if you take 120 - - let me do it over here.
1 plus 2 plus 0, well, that 's equal to 1 plus 2 is 3 plus 0
is 3, and 3 is definitely divisible by 3.
So 120 is going to be divisible by 3.
To figure what that number that you have to multiply by 3
is, you could do it in your head.
You could say, well, 3 goes into 12 four times, and then
you - - well, let me just do it out, just in case, just for
those of you who want to see it worked out.
3 goes into 12 four times.
4 times 3 is 12.
You subtract.
You 're left with nothing here.
You bring down this 0.
3 goes into 0 zero times.
0 times 3 is 0.
Nothing left over.
So it goes into it forty times.

And the way to think of it in your head is this is the same
thing as 12 times 10.
12 divided by 3 is 4, but this is going to be 4 times 10,
because you have that 10 left over.
Whatever works for you.
Or you can just ignore the 0, divide by 3, you get a 4, and
then put the 0 back there.
Whatever works.
So we have two more factors.
At the low end, we have 3, and at the high end, we have a 40.
Now, let 's see if 4 divisible into 120.
Now we saw the divisibility rule for 4 is you ignore
everything beyond the tens places and you just look at
the last two digits.
So if we 're going to to think about whether 4 is divisible,
you just look at the last two digits.
The last two digits are 20.
20 is definitely divisible by 4, so 120 will be
divisible by 4.
4 is going to be a factor.
And to figure out what we have to multiply 4 by to get 120,
you could do it in your head.
You could say 12 divided by 4 is 3, so 120
divided by 4 is 30.
So we have two more factors: 4 and 30.
And you could work this out in long division if you want to
make sure that this works out, so let 's keep going.
And then we have 120 is equal to - - is 5 a factor?
Is 5 times something equal to 120?
Well, you can 't do that simple - - well, first of all,
we could just test is it divisible?
And 120 ends with a 0.
If you end with a 0 or a 5, you are divisible by 5.
So 5 definitely goes into it.
Let 's figure out how many times.
So 5 goes into 120.
It doesn 't go into 1.
It goes into 12 two times.
2 times 5 is 10.
Subtract.
You get 2.
Bring down the 0.
5 goes into 20 four times.
4 times 5 is 20, and then you subtract, and you have no left
over, as we expect, because it should go in evenly.
This number ends with a 0 or a 5.
Let me delete all of this so we can have our scratch space
to work with later on.
So 5 times 24 is also equal to 120, we have two more
factors: 5 and 24.
Let me clear up some space here because I think we 're
going to be dealing with a lot of factors.
So let me move this right here.
Let me cut it and then let me paste it and move this over
here so we have more space for our factors.
So we have 5 and 24.
Let 's move on to 6.
So 120 is equal to 6 times what?
Now, to be divisible by 6, you have to be
divisible by 2 and 3.
Now, we know that we 're already divisible by 2 and 3,
so we 're definitely going to be divisible by 6, and you
should hopefully be able to do this one in your head.
5 was a little bit harder to do in your head. but 120, you
could say, well, 12 divided by 6 is 2, and then you have that
0 there, so 120 divided by 6 would be 20.
And you could work it out in long division if you like.
So 6 times 20 are two more factors.

Now let 's think about 7.
Let 's think about 7 here.
7 is a very bizarre number, and just to test it, you could
think of other ways to do it.
Let 's just try to divide 7 into 120.
7 doesn 't go into 1.
It goes into 12 one time.
1 times 7 is 7.
You subtract.
12 minus 7 is 5.
Bring down the 0.
7 times 7 is 49, so it goes into it seven times.
7 times 7 is 49.
Subtract.
You have a remainder, so it does not divide evenly.
So 7 does not work.

Now let 's think about 8.
Let 's think about whether 8 works.
Let 's think about 8.
I 'll do the same process.
Let 's take 8 into 120.
Let 's just work it out.
And just as a little bit of a hint - - well, I 'll
just work it out.
8 goes into 12 - - it doesn 't go into 1, so it
goes into 12 one time.
1 times 8 is 8.
Subtract there.
12 minus 8 is 4.
Bring down the 0.
8 goes into 40 five times.
5 times 8 is 40, and you 're left with no remainder, so it
goes evenly.
So 120 - - let me get rid of that.
120 is equal to 8 times 15, so let 's add that to our factor
list. We now have an 8 and now we have a 15.
Now, is it divisible by 9?
Is 120 divisible by 9?
To test that out, you just add up the digits.
1 plus 2 plus 0 is equal to 3.
Well, that 'll satisfy our 3 divisibility rule, but 3 is
not divisible by 9, so our number will not be
divisible by 9.
So 9 will not work out.
9 does not work out.
So let 's move on to 10.
Well, this is pretty straightforward.
It ends in 0, so we will be divisible by 10.
So let me write that down.
120 is equal to 10 times - - and this is pretty
straightforward - - 10 times 12.
This is exactly what 120 is.
It 's 10 times 12, so let' s write those factors down.
10 and 12.
And then we have one number left.
We have 11.
We don 't have to go above 11, because we already went
through 12, and we know that there aren 't any factors above
that, because we were going in descending order, so we 've
really filled in all the gaps.
You could try 11.
We could try it by hand, if you like.
11 goes into 120 - - now you know, if with you know your
multiplication tables through 11, that this won 't work, but
I 'll just show you.
11 goes into 12 one time.
1 times 11 is 11.
Subtract.
1, bring down the 0.
11 goes into 10 zero times.
0 times 11 is 0.
you 're left with a remainder of 10.
So 11 goes into 20 ten times with a remainder of 10.
It definitely does not go in evenly.
So we have all of our factors here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10,
12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60 and 120.
And we 're done!

The next kind of graph we 're going to look at is called a hypercube,
and the graph is almost but not quite as cool as the name.
We 're going to define a hypercube for any number of nodes as long as
that number of nodes is a power of 2.
Here we have four nodes. That 's a power of 2 - - 2Â˛.
What we 're going to do is we' re going to connect edges up in a particular way.
This is how we 're going to do it. We' re going to imagine that every node has a label.
That label is a bit pattern.
In particular, we 're going to imagine that we' re going to number each of the nodes,
basically, from 0 up to n - 1.
We 're going to connect two nodes if their bit patters differ in exactly one place.
We see this example here.
If we label the nodes - - these are now binary numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 - -
we connect these two nodes because they differ just in the first bit - - 11, 01.
We connect these two because they differ in the second bit - - 10, 11.
We connect these two because they differ in the second place - - 00, 01.
And we connect these two because they differ in the first place - - 00, 10.
We can generalize this to larger graphs.
Here 's a hypercube on eight nodes.
We number the nodes from 0 to 7 in their binary bit patterns.
Then we connect two nodes if they differ in exactly one bit place.
Now, perhaps you can see why these are called hypercubes. This is a cube.
The previous one was a square. What 's the next one going to be?
To generate the hypercube for n = 16, we can do this with a very interesting little trick.
What we 're going to do is we' re going to take two hypercubes of size 8 and 8.
Now 8 and 8 is going to be 16. Let 's look at what we can do.
We can leave these bit patterns the way that they are,
and then we can extend them.
Everybody in this hypercube is going to get a 0 in front.
Remember what that means in terms of the binary numbers is that they say the same.
A leading 0 doesn 't change anything,
but this second hypercube everyone is going to get a one out in front.
Again, thinking about your binary numbers, what is that doing?
It 's adding 8 to all of the number of these nodes,
giving unique bit patterns that we haven 't seen before.
Now if we connect the corresponding corners of these two cubes,
which is going to be a little bit messy, and I can draw them deeper,
but it 'll start to make the picture a little distracting.
That is a 4 - dimensional cube, also known as a hypercube.
We can keep extending this over and over again - - 5 - bit patterns, 6 - bit patterns, 7 - bit patterns.
Each time what we 're doing is connecting two hypercubes of the previous size,
extending them and then connecting the corresponding vertices.

When I look at an existing market, it 's clear that if you' ve match those market needs,
you could be achieving profitability the soonest.
If you 're doing a clone market - - that is copying a US business model in a foreign country,
that probably is the second closest to immediate profitability because you know the market exist
that you just need to implement it in your local country.
Resegmented market - - well, that 's probably somewhere in between existing in clone and new
because you not only have to understand the market you have to understand
the customer 's specific needs or low - cost needs.
But the longest time to profitability is a new market.
You have a vision that you understand what the future might look like, but the market
just hasn 't adapted yet and that might take years.

Welcome to the presentation on quadratic inequalities.
Before we get to quadratic inequalities, let 's just start
graphing some functions and interpret them and then we 'll
slowly move to the inequalities.
Let 's say I had f of x is equal to x squared plus x minus 6.
Well, if we wanted to figure out where this function
intersects the x - axis or the roots of it, we learned in our
factoring quadratics that we could just set f of x
is equal to 0, right?
Because f of x equals 0 when you 're intersecting the x - axis.
So you would say x squared plus x minus 6 is equal to 0.
And you just factor this quadratic.
x plus 3 times x minus 2 equals 0.
And you would learn that the roots of this quadratic
function are x is equal to minus 3, and x is equal to 2.
How would we visualize this?
Well let 's draw this quadratic function.
Those are my very uneven lines.
So the roots are x is equal to negative 3.
So this is, right here, x is at minus 3y0 - - by definition one
of the roots is where f of x is equal to 0.
So the y, or the f of x axis here is 0.
The coordinate is 0.
And this point here is 2 comma 0.
Once again, this is the x - axis, and this is the f of x - axis.
We also know that the y intercept is minus 6.
This isn 't the vertex, this is the y intercept.
And that the graph is going to look something like this - - not
as bumpy as what I 'm drawing, which I think you get the
general idea if you 've ever seen a clean parabola.
It looks like that with x minus 3 here, and x is 2 here.
We figured out the roots, we figured out what it looks like.
Now what if we, instead of wanting to know where f of x is
equal to 0, which is these two points, what if we wanted
to know where f of x is greater than 0?
What x values make f of x greater than 0?
Or another way of saying it, what values make
x squared plus x minus 6 is greater than 0, Right,
this is just f of x.
Well if we look at the graph, when is f of x greater than 0?
Well this is the f of x axis, and when are we
in positive territory?
Well f of x is greater than 0 here - - let me draw that
another color - - is greater than 0 here, right?
Because it 's above the x - axis.
And f of x is greater than 0 here.
So just visually looking at it, what x values make this true?
Well, this is true whenever x is less than minus 3, right, or
whenever x is greater than 2.
Because when x is greater than 2, f of x is greater than 0,
and when x is less than negative 3, f of x
is greater than 0.
So we would say the solution to this quadratic inequality, and
we pretty much solved this visually, is x is less than
minus 3, or x is greater than 2.
And you could test it out.
You could try out the number minus 4, and you should get f
of x being greater than 0.
You could try it out here.
Or you could try the number 3 and make sure that this works.
And you can just make sure that, you could, for example,
try out the number 0 and make sure that 0 doesn 't work,
right, because 0 is between the two roots.
It actually turns out that when x is equal to 0, f
of x is minus 6, which is definitely less than 0.
So I think this will give you a visual intuition of what this
quadratic inequality means.
Now with that visual intuition in the back of your mind, let 's
do some more problems and maybe we won 't have to go through the
exercise of drawing it, but maybe I will draw it just to
make sure that the point hits home.
Let me give you a slightly trickier problem.
Let 's say I had minus x squared minus 3x plus 28, let me
say, is greater than 0.
Well I want to get rid of this negative sign in
front of the x squared.
I just don 't like it there because it makes it look
more confusing to factor.
I 'm going to multiply everything by negative 1.
Both sides.
I get x squared plus 3x minus 28, and when you multiply or
divide by a negative, with any inequality you have
to swap the sign.
So this is now going to be less than 0.
And if we were to factor this, we get x plus 7 times x
of this function - - let 's define the function f of x - -
let 's define the function as f of x is equal to - - well we can
define it as this or this because they 're the same thing.
But for simplicity let 's define it as x plus 7 times x minus 4.
That 's f of x, right?
Well, after factoring it, we know that the roots of this,
the roots are x is equal to minus 7, and x is equal to 4.
Now what we want to know is what x values make
this inequality true?
If this was any equality we 'd be done.
But we want to know what makes this inequality true.
I 'll give you a little bit of a trick, it' s always going to be
the numbers in between the two roots or outside
of the two roots.
So what I do whenever I 'm doing this on a test or something, I
just test numbers that are either between the roots or
outside of the two roots.
So let 's pick a number that' s between x equals minus
7 and x equals 4.
Well let 's try x equals 0.
Well, f of 0 is equal to - - we could do it right here - - f of
0 is 0 plus 7 times 0 minus 4 is just 7 times minus
4, which is minus 28.
So f of 0 is minus 28.
Now is this - - this is the function we 're working with
- - is this less than 0?
Well yeah, it is.
So it actually turns that a number, an x value between
the two roots works.
So actually I immediately know that the answer here
is all of the x 's that are between the two roots.
So we could say that the solution to this is
minus 7 is less than x which is less than 4.
Because now the other way.
You could have tried a number that 's outside of the roots,
either less than minus 7 or greater than 4 and
have tried it out.
Let 's say if you had tried out 5.
Try x equals 5.
Well then f of 5 would be 12 times 1, right,
which is equal to 12.
f of 5 is 12.
Is that less than 0?
No.
So that wouldn 't have worked.
So once again, that gives us a confidence that we
got the right interval.
And if we wanted to think about this visually, because we got
this answer, when you do it visually it actually makes, I
think, a lot of sense, but maybe I 'm biased.
If you look at it visually it looks like this.
If you draw it visually and this is the parabola, this is f of
x, the roots here are minus 7, 0 and 4, 0, we 're saying that
for all x values between these two numbers, f of
x is less than 0.
And that makes sense, because when is f of x less than 0?
Well this is the graph of f of x.
And when is f of x less than 0?
Right here.
So what x values give us that?
Well the x values that give us that are right here.
I hope I 'm not confusing you too much with
these visual graphs.
And you 're probably saying, well how do I know
I don 't include 0?
Well you could try it out, but if you - - oh, well how come
I don 't include the roots?
Well at the roots, f of x is equal to 0.
So if this was this, if this was less than or equal to 0,
then the answer would be negative 7 is less than
or equal to x is less than or equal to 4.
I hope that gives you a sense.
You pretty much just have to try number in between the
roots, and try number outside of the roots, and that tells
you what interval will make the inequality true.
I 'll see you in the next presentation.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Let 's
say I have the indefinite integral 1 over the square
root of 3 minus 2x squared.
Of course I have a dx there.
So right when I look at that, there 's no obvious
traditional method of taking this antiderivative.
I don 't have the derivative of this sitting someplace else in
the integral, so I can 't do traditional u - substitution.
But what I can do is I could say, well, this almost looks
like some trig identities that I 'm familiar with, so maybe I
can substitute with trig functions.
So let 's see if I can find a trig identity that
looks similar to this.
Well, our most basic trigonometric identity - - this
comes from the unit circle definition - - is that the sine
squared of theta plus the cosine squared of
theta is equal to 1.
And then if we subtract cosine squared of theta from both
sides, we get - - or if we subtract sine squared of theta
from both sides, we could do either - - we could get cosine
squared of theta is equal to 1 minus sine squared of theta.
We could do either way.
But this, all of a sudden, this thing right here, starts to
look a little bit like this.
Maybe I can do a little bit of algebraic manipulation to make
this look a lot like that.
So the first thing, I would like to have a 1 here - - at
least, that 's how my brain works - - so let' s factor out a
3 out of this denominator.
So this is the same thing as the integral of 1 over the
square root of - - let me factor out a 3 out of this expression.
3 times 1 minus 2 / 3x squared.
I did nothing fancy here.
I just factored the 3 out of this expression,
that 's all I did.
But the neat thing now is, this expression looks a
lot like that expression.
In fact, if I substitute, if I say that this thing right here,
this 2 / 3x squared, if I set it equal to sine squared theta, I
will be able to use this identity.
So let 's do that.
Let 's set 2 / 3x squared, let' s set that equal to sine
squared of theta.
So if we take the square root of both sides of this equation,
I get the square root of 2 over the square root of 3 times x is
equal to the sine of theta.
If I want to solve for x, what do I get?
And, well, we 're going to have to solve for both
x and for theta, so let 's do it both ways.
First, let 's solve for theta.
If we solve for theta, you get that theta is equal to the
arcsine, or the inverse sine, of square root of 2 over
square root of 3x.
That 's if you solve for theta.
Now, if you solve for x, you just multiply both sides of
this equation times the inverse of this and you get x is equal
to - - divide both sides of the equation by this or multiply it
by the inverse - - is equal to the square root of 3 over the
square root of 2 times the sine of theta.
And we were going to substitute this with sine squared of
theta, but we can 't leave this dx out there.
So the derivative of x with respect to theta is equal to
square root of 3 over square root of 2.
Derivative of this with respect to theta is just cosine of
theta, and if we want to write this in terms of dx, we could
just write that dx is equal to square root of 3 over the
square root of 2 cosine of theta d theta.
Now we 're ready to substitute.
So we can rewrite this expression up here - - I 'll do it
in this reddish color - - I was using that, let me do
it in the blue color.
We can rewrite this expression up here now.
It 's an indefinite integral of - - dx is on the
numerator, right?
Instead of writing this 1 times dx, I could have
just written a dx up here.
That could be a dx just like that.
You 're just multiplying it times dx.
So what 's dx?
dx is this business.
I 'll do it in yellow.
dx is this right here.
So it 's the square root of 3 over the square root of
2 cosine theta d theta.
That 's what dx was.
Now, the denominator in my equation, I have the square
root of 3 times - - now it 's 1 minus.
Now I said 2 / 3x squared is equal to sine squared of theta.
93 00: 04: 47, 64 - - > 00: 04: 49, 75 Now how can I simplify this?
Well, what 's 1 minus sine squared of theta?
That 's cosine squared of theta.
So this thing right here is cosine squared of theta.
So my indefinite integral becomes the square root of 3
over the square root of 2 cosine theta d theta, all of
that over the square root of 3 times the cosine
squared of theta.
That just became cosine squared of theta.
So let 's just take the square root of this bottom part.
So this is going to be equal to - - I 'll do an arbitrary
change of colors - - square root of 3 over the square root of 2
cosine of theta d theta, all of that over - - what 's the
square root of this?
It 's equal to the square root of 3 times the square root
of cosine squared, so times cosine of theta.
Now, this simplifies things a good bit.
I have a cosine of theta divided by a cosine of theta,
those cancel out, so we 'll just get 1, and then I have a square
root of 3 up here divided by a square root of 3, so those two
guys are going to cancel out, so my integral simplifies
nicely to 1 over square root of 2 d theta.
Or even better, I could write this - - this is just a constant
term, I could take it out of my integral - - it equals 1 over the
square root of 2 times my integral of just d theta.
And this is super easy.
This is equal to 1 over the square root of 2
times theta plus c.
Plus some constant.
I mean, you could say that the integral of this is theta plus
c and then you 'd multiply the constant times this, but it' s
still going to be some arbitrary constant.
I think you know how to take the antiderivative of this.
But are we done?
Well, no.
We want to know our indefinite integral in terms of x.
So now we have to reverse substitute.
So what is theta?
We figured that out here. theta is equal to arcsine the square
root of 2 over the square root of 3x.
So our original indefinite integral, which was all of this
silliness up here, now that I reverse substitute for theta or
put x back in there, it 's 1 over the square root
of 2 times theta.
theta is just this, is just arcsine of square root of 2
over square root of 3 x, and then I have this constant
out here, plus c.
So this right here is the antiderivative of
1 over the square root of 3 minus 2x squared.
So hopefully you found that helpful.
I 'm going to do a couple of more videos where we go through
a bunch of these examples, just so that you get
familiar with them.

What breadth first search does is it always expands out in levels.
So h expands into i and j, one and the other first, and then one of the other of these
has expanded but with only one level, and before we go any deeper, 3 has nodes,
j 's nodes get expanded next, and only after everything distance 2
away from h has been expanded, will o all get its chance.

What we used to believe for strategy
is that you start any company with an operating plan and a financial model.
What 's an operating plan? Well, it' s the business plan.
And the belief was all I need to do is spend a lot of time writing this plan,
and then all I need to do is execute it and somehow magical thinking said if I thought hard enough
and if I was smart enough to do all the great market research in the library and looking up all the data
and then put together a forecast the magic 5 - year plan in the back of the business plan
somehow magically all I needed to do is hire the people to execute that plan.
If that doesn 't sound silly to you now, don' t worry because it didn 't sound silly for 40 years,
but what we now know that 's kind of ridiculous.
What we now know is that no business plan survives first contact with customers.
The first years on a startup is completely unpredictable.
What you think you 're doing on Monday turns out to be completely wrong on Tuesday,
and on Wednesday, you discover something new, and on Friday, you 're almost out of business,
but on Monday you gets next Monday you get sold for a billion dollars.
A startup is an incredible roller coaster unpredictable series of advance
that there 's no way you could put together in a 5 - year plan.
Yet somehow investors and educators thought that maybe we could just teach you
how to put this all together in a nice spreadsheet.
No one ever noticed that the only other people to do 5 - year plans were these guys,
the Soviet Union, and we kind of know how well that turned out as well.
Though much like the fallacy about business plans and financial forecast that lasted for about 80 years.
The good news is that we now know that business plans and financial forecast
first are just as silly as it was in the Soviet Union.
No business plan survives first contact with customers.
This doesn 't mean we shouldn' t have any planning but it actually means
what we need is planning before the plan and what that really mean is
you need to figure out how to actually do some planning
and then you get to write the business plan.
So I 'll be clear, I' m not suggesting we never want to do an operating plan
and I 'm not suggesting we never want forecast but you need some real facts before you could do that
and one of the ways we 're going to organize our facts
is with Alexander Oscar Walters' Business Model Canvas.
We 'll talk about this canvas in some excruciating detail in the following lectures
but you should know we used to canvas for two things.
One is initially we 're going to use it organize our thinking
about all the hypothesis about every part of our business.
But second is we 're going to get out of the building and actually turn those hypothesis into fact as we' ll
find out how to do later and then as we turn those hypothesis into facts,
we 'll be updating the canvas on a regular basis and it will become a scorecard - -
a way to keep score for our progress of how much we 've learned.
So what this means is instead of writing the operating plan and financial forecast first,
we 're going to use the Business Model Canvas to actually capture all our hypothesis first.
For the search for the business model, we 're going to start with the model first
and then after we find the model, we get to write it up.

So in understanding our customer segments,
it was really helpful to pictures up and as
we build an archetype of who our three potential
customer segments are. The first one we
called Gasol, the next one we called Junior,
and then the third we called Becky. And
we talked about their age, their income,
their demographics. Whether they were
buyer, or whether they were – they were
wearing the jersey as a social statement or
whether they were actually a social sports viewer.
What kind of fan type were they Avid,
In - Season, Casual. What kind of class were
they? Were they upper class and could
they afford anything? Or were they
middleclass or could they barely – they
don’t even have a credit card. What
was their Facebook status, and more
importantly, what kind of rental type
would they like. And it turned out that
it was really helpful to kind of understand
our pricing model and our revenue streams.
So archetypes really helped us understand
our customers, they value prop, the
revenue and some of our pricing tactics.

I want you to analyze the running time of Dijkstra and ideally, I would just ask you
but given that you can 't answer me directly,
I 'm going to have to make this a multiple choice question.
And it turns out that you don 't have enough information to answer it.
So for you to be able to answer it, what were do you need to know.
So the running time of Dijkstra in terms of n and M and here 's a sketch of the algorithm again.
Remember for each node it finds the shortest distance so far - - it removes that distance
from the set and then it checks each of the neighbors.
I 've got a node that it found the shortest node - - it does a little bit of competition - -
constant competition for each of those before going up and starting again with another node.
But you will have enough to answer this question - - is it because the running time depends
on how find shortest is implemented, is that because it depends on the degree of the nodes
in question or is it because it depends if the graph is dense or sparse.
You 'll get a different answer in those cases. So just check which one and I' ll give you some feedback.

Let 's get going with more examples of function problems, and
hopefully as we keep doing this, you 're going to get
the idea of how all this stuff works.
So let 's do another problem.
I 'll use green this time.
Let me clear everything.
So I 'll show you - - I showed you that 1, you could define a
function as just kind of a standard algebraic expression,
you could also do it a kind of if number is odd, this is what
you do, if a number is this, is what you do.
You could also define a function visually.
Let 's say - - let me draw a graph, and I' ll use the line
tool so it 's a reasonably neat graph - - that' s
the x - axis there.
That 's pretty good.
And let 's draw the f of x - axis, or you might be used to calling
that the y - axis, but - - OK.
I almost had it vertical, but let 's see.
Let 's draw a few slashes here.
And a couple here, like this.
Sorry if you 're getting bored while I draw this graph.
I should really have some type of tool so that the
graphs just show up.
Let me draw a - - let 's say that - - let me
draw this function.
So this is what?
This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, this is negative 5, this is 5, this
is 5, this is negative 5.
And this is x - axis, and this is - - we 'll call
this the f of x - axis.
Now that might not seem obvious to you at first, but all this
is saying is let 's say when x is equal to negative 5, this
function - - I 'm creating a function definition - - let' s say
it equals 2, that 's negative 1, that stays the same, that stays
the same, then it goes to here, and then it goes to here, to
here, and then - - let 's see.
I hope I 'm not boring you.
And it just keeps moving up.
Let me see, what would this look like - - this
would look like this.
So if I - - you might think I 'm doing something very strange
right now, but just bear with me while I draw this.
I hope I don 't mess up too much.
And, see, one like that.
See one like that.
So we 're like, Sal, this is a very strange looking graph.
And it is.
But what this is, is this is a function definition.
This tells you whenever I input an x, at least for the x 's that
we can see on the graph, this graph tell me what
f of x equals.
So if x is equal to negative 5, f of x would equal plus 2.
And we could draw a couple of examples.
f of 0, well we go to 0 on the x - axis, and we say
f of 0 is equal to 0.
f of 1 is equal to - - well, we go to x equal to 1, and we
just see where the chart is, well, it equals negative 1.
I think you get the idea.
This isn 't too difficult, but this is a function definition.
So we 've defined this graph right here as f of x.
So if that graph - - that 's the graph of f of x, and let' s say
that we define g of x is equal to f of x - - let 's say
it 's equal to f of x squared minus f of x.
And let 's say that h of x is equal to 3 minus x.
So what if I were to ask you, what is h of g of negative 1?
So just like we did in the previous problems, first we 'll
say, well, let 's try to figure out what g of negative 1 is,
and then we can substitute that into h of x.
So g of negative 1 is equal to - - and this is how I do it.
There 's no trick to it.
Wherever you see the x, you just substitute it with the
number that you 're saying is now the value for x.
So you say, well, that 's equal to f of negative 1 squared
minus f of negative 1.
All I did is at g of negative 1, I just substituted
it wherever I saw an x.
Well what 's f of negative 1?
Well, when x is equal to negative 1, f of
x is equal to 1.
So f of negative 1 - - let 's write that, f of negative
1 is equal to 1.
So g of negative 1 is equal to - - well, that 's just
1 squared minus 1, well that equals 0.
Because f of negative 1 is 1, so it 's 1 squared minus
1 that equals 1 minus 1.
0.
So g of negative 1 is 0, so this is the
same thing as h of 0.
Because g of negative 1, we just figured out is 0.
h of 0, we just take that 0 and substitute it here, so it 's 3
minus 0, so that just equals 3.
And we solved the problem.
Let 's do another example, and I don' t want to erase my graph
since I took four minutes to actually draw it, let me
erase what we just did here.
And what you might want to do after you watch it the first
time - - and this isn 't true just of this video, actually of all
the videos - - but especially the functions, after watching it
once, you might want to rewatch it and pause it right after I
give you the problem and try to do it yourself, and then see - -
and if you get stuck, you can play it, or if you get an
answer, just you can play the video and make sure that
we did the same way.
Let 's see.
I 'm going to create another definition
for g of x this time.
Let 's say that g of x - - oh whoops, I was trying to write
in black - - let 's say that g of x is equal to f of x
squared plus f of x plus 2.
So now, in this case, what is g of - - let 's pick a random
number - - what is g of minus - - no, let 's pick a, let' s
say - - what is g of minus 2?
After we try and pick a number that we could find
an actual solution for.
Well g of minus 2, wherever we see the x, x is not
going to be minus 2.
That is equal to f of minus 2 squared plus
f of minus 2 plus 2.
All we did is wherever we saw an x, we substituted
it, minus 2 there.
And let 's simplify that.
Well, f of minus 2 squared, we know what minus 2 squared is,
that 's the same thing as f of 4, plus f of minus 2 plus 2.
That 's 0.
Plus f of 0.
And now we just figure out what f of 4 and f of 0 is.
Well, f of 4, we go where x equals r, it 's right here,
and when x equals 4, f of 4 is equal to 2.
So this is equal to 2 plus f of 0.
And just as a reminder, this is the definition of f.
We didn 't define it in terms of an algebraic expression, we
defined in terms of an actual visual graph.
So what 's f of 0? f of 0 is 0.
When x is equal to 0 - - f of 0 is 0 so that 's 2 plus 0 - - so g
of negative 2 is equal to 2.
An interesting thing, you might want to make problems like this
for yourself and keep experimenting with different
types of functions, and a very interesting thing would
actually be to graph g of x, and actually that 's a
good idea, I think.
I think maybe we 'll do that in the future modules to kind of
play with functions and actually to try graph
the functions and see how they turn out.
I will - - I don 't know if I have enough time - - actually, I' m
going to wait until the next lecture to do a couple
more examples.
I want to do as many examples on the functions as I can with
you, because I think as you keep watching and watching the
function problems and seeing more and more variations on
functions, you 'll see both how general of a concept this is,
and hopefully you 'll get an idea of how the functions
actually work.
Well, I 'll see you in the next lecture.
Have fun.

Our second guest is Tina Eliassi - Rad, a computer science professor
at Rutger 's University.
She studies data mining and machine learning with a special emphasis
on the data that comes up in network science.
There 's been an explosion in interest in studying networks and network science.
If you could comment a little bit about where Big Data is coming from.
[Tina Eliassi - Rad, Associate Professers, Rutgers University] Big Data is being generated by us.
We go on Twitter and we tweet away.
We go on Facebook, and we post photos and we post status updates.
That 's actually where a lot of the Big Data nowadays is coming from.
Also, the other aspects, if you think about healthcare - -
all the MRI imaging and all these other kinds of tasks that now are done with computers,
that 's where Big Data is coming from.
In particular, because the idea is that if you analyze the data,
that data will tell you something about your customers
and then you can better serve your customers and then your profits will go higher.

By the way just as on the side, I 've been talking about problem or need as part of the product.
And I just want you to remember it 's kind of interesting to differentiate between
solving a problem or if somebody who has an accounting problem or a word processor
or they can now use Google docs versus Microsoft Word versus a need.
What 's a need? Well, a need might be a need to be entertained or a need to communicate.
Needs are something that are universal across all 7 billion people on the planet.
Your total available market plus or minus a couple of billion.
Maybe kids 0 - 5 don 't have those needs but eventually you will find market sizes
for needs to be multiples by orders of magnitude above solving problems.
And so, I 'm not suggesting that you don' t solve problems.
I 'm not suggesting that you try to turn every problem into a need.
But let me suggest the one company in the 21st century that did this better
than anybody else in the planet was Apple and the iPhone.
They took a communications device and made it a status symbol, and they transitioned
from a product that solved a problem, integrated web browser, e - mail, and phone
into something that people now every year obsolete their own products by wanting to get
the next one because it 's now a need rather than a product.

A bit of a classic implicit differentiation problem
is the problem y is equal to x to the x.
And then to find out what the derivative of y
is with respect to x.
And people look at that, oh you know, I don 't have just a
constant exponent here, so I can 't just use the power
rules, how do you do it.
And the trick here is really just to take the natural log of
both sides of this equation.
And this is going to build up to what we 're going to
do later in this video.
So If you take the natural log on both sides of this equation,
you get the natural log of y is equal to the natural
log of x to the x.
Now our power rules, or I guess our natural log rules, say
look, if I 'm taking the natural log of something to the
log of x to the x as being equal to x times the
natural log of x.
So let me rewrite everything again.
If I take the natural log of both sides of that equation, I
get the natural log of y is equal to x times the
natural log of x.
And now we can take the derivative of both sides of
this with respect to x.
So the derivative with respect to x of that, and then
the derivative with respect to x of that.
Now we 're going to apply a little bit of the chain rule.
So the chain rule.
What 's the derivative of this with respect to x?
What 's the derivative of our inner expression
with respect to x?
It 's a little implicit differentiation, so it' s dy
with respect to x times the derivative of this whole
thing with respect to this inner function.
So the derivative of natural log of x is 1 / x.
So the derivative of natural log of y with
respect to y is 1 / y.
And the derivative of this - - this is just the product rule,
and I 'll arbitrarily switch colors here - - is the derivative
of the first term, which is 1, times the second term, so times
the natural log of x plus the derivative of the second term,
which is 1 / x times the first term.
So times x.
And so we get dy / dx times 1 / y is equal to natural log of x
plus - - this just turns out to be 1 - - x divided by x, and
then you multiply both sides of this by y.
You get dy / dx is equal to y times the natural
log of x plus 1.
And if you don 't like this y sitting here, you could just
make the substitution.
y is equal to x to the x.
So you could say that the derivative of y with respect to
x is equal to x to the x times the natural log of x plus 1.
And that 's a fun problem, and this is often kind of given as
a trick problem, or sometimes even a bonus problem if people
don 't know to take the natural log of both sides of that.
But I was given an even more difficult problem, and
that 's what we' re going to tackle in this.
But it 's good to see this problem done first because it
gives us the basic tools.
So the more difficult problem we 're going to
deal with is this one.
Let me write it down.
So the problem is y is equal to x to the - - and here 's the
twist - - x to the x to the x.
And we want to find out dy / dx.
We want to find out the derivative of y
with respect to x.
So to solve this problem we essentially use the same tools.
We use the natural log to essentially breakdown this
exponent and get it into terms that we can deal with.
So we can use the product rule.
So let 's take the natural log of both sides of this equation
like we did last time.
You get the natural log of y is equal to the natural log
of x to the x to the x.
So we can rewrite this as x to the x times the natural log
times the natural log of x.
So now our expression our equation is simplified to the
natural log of y is equal to x to the x times the
natural log of x.
But we still have this nasty x to the x here.
We know no easy way to take the derivative there, although I 've
actually just shown you what the derivative of this is, so
we could actually just apply it right now.
I was going to take the natural log again and it would turn
into this big, messy, confusing thing but I realized that
earlier in this video I just solved for what the
derivative of x to the x is.
It 's this thing right here.
It 's this crazy expression right here.
So we just have to remember that and then apply and
then do our problem.
So let 's do our problem.
And if we hadn 't solved this ahead of time, it was kind of
an unexpected benefit of doing the simpler version of the
problem, you could just keep taking the natural log of this,
but it 'll just get a little bit messier.
But since we already know what the derivative of x to the
x is, let 's just apply it.
So we 're going to take the derivative of both
sides of the equation.
Derivative of this is equal to the derivative of this.
We 'll ignore this for now.
Derivative of this with respect to x is the derivative of
the natural log of y with respect to y.
So that 's 1 / y times the derivative of y
with respect to x.
That 's just the chain rule.
We learned that in implicit differentiation.
And so this is equal to the derivative of the first term
times the second term, and I 'm going to write it out here just
because I don 't want to skip steps and confuse people.
So this is equal to the derivative with respect to x of
x to the x times the natural log of x plus the derivative
with respect to x of the natural log of
x times x to the x.
So let 's focus on the right hand side of this equation.
What is the derivative of x to the x with respect to x?
Well we just solved that problem right here.
It 's x to the x natural log of x plus 1.
So this piece right there - - I already forgot what it
was - - it was x to the x natural log of x plus 1.
That is x to the x times the natural log of x plus 1.
And then we 're going to multiply that times
And then we 're going to add that to, plus the derivative
of the natural log of x.
And of course the left hand side of the equation
was just 1 / y dy / dx.
And we can multiply both sides of this now by y, and we get
dy / dx is equal to y times all of this crazy stuff - - x to the
x times the natural log of x plus 1 times the natural log of
x plus 1 / x times x to the x.
That 's x to the negative 1.
We could rewrite this as x to the minus 1, and then
you add the exponents.
You could write this as x to the x minus 1 power.
And if we don 't like this y here, we can just
substitute it back.
y was equal to this, this crazy thing right there.
So our final answer for this seemingly - - well on one level
looks like a very simple problem, but on another level
when you appreciate what it 's saying, it' s like oh there 's a
very complicated problem - - you get the derivative of y with
respect to x is equal to y, which is this.
So that 's x to the x to the x times all of this stuff - - times
x to the x natural log of x plus 1 times the natural log
of x, and then all of that plus x to the x minus 1.
So who would have thought.
Sometimes math is elegant.
You take the derivative of something like this and
you get something neat.
For example, when you take the derivative of natural
log of x you get 1 / x.
That 's very simple and elegant, and it' s nice that math
worked out that way.
But sometimes you do something, you take an operation on
something that looks pretty simple and elegant, and you get
something that 's hairy and not that pleasant to look
at, but is a pretty interesting problem.

Welcome to the presentation on multiplying decimals.
Let 's get started.
So I think you 'll find out that multiplying decimals
is not a lot more difficult than just multiplying regular numbers.
And I 'll show you in a problem.
Lets say, let me pick some random numbers.
Let 's say I had seven thousand five hundred eighteen.
Actually, let 's make that' s seventy - five point one eight.
Clearly you can tell I 'm doing this on the fly.
Seventy - five point one eight times zero point nine seven.
So first you look at this problem and you 're like, oh boy that' s tough.
These decimals - - I don 't even know how to approach it.
Well this is what you do.
You ignore the decimals when you start the problem
and you pretend like it 's just a regular multiplication problem.
And if you ignore the decimals, it would be like I said at the beginning,
seven thousand five hundred eighteen on top and ninety - seven on the bottom.
And if that doesn 't make sense let me just show you.
I 'm just going to ignore the decimals
and do this like a normal multiplication problem.
So normal multiplication.
I 'd start at the ones place right here.
I 'd say seven times eight.
Well, seven times eight is fifty - six.
Carry the five.
Seven times one is seven.
Plus the five is twelve.
Two down here.
Carry the one.
Seven times five is thirty - five.
Plus the one is thirty - six.
Put the six here.
Carry the three.
And then seven times seven is forty - nine.
Plus three is fifty - two.
So just put fifty - two here.
So just like normal multiplication
we just took the ones place right here, the seven.
So it 's actually not the ones,
but we 're ignoring the decimals
so if there were no decimals this would be the ones place.
And we 're multiplying it by the top number.
Seven times seven thousand five hundred eighteen is equal to fifty - two thousand six hundred twenty - six.
And just like regular multiplication, we do the tens place.
And this isn 't really the tens place,
but if you ignore the decimals it would be.
And let 's cross all this stuff out since we' re not using it.
Nine times eight is seventy - two.
Carry the seven.
Nine times one is nine.
Plus seven is sixteen.
Carry the one.
Nine times five is forty - five.
This is good practice for me, too.
I haven 't done my multiplication tables in a long time.
Nine times five is forty - five.
Plus one is forty - six.
Carry the four.
Nine times seven is sixty - three.
Plus four is sixty - seven.
Now we add.
So you 're probably thinking, boy, what do decimals have to do with this at all?
I 'm just doing a regular multiplication problem.
And I 'll show you.
Actually the decimals only come in right at the very end.
So what I do is now I just add like I do a regular level four multiplication problem.
So I say six plus zero is six.
Two plus two is four.
Six plus six is twelve.
Carry the one.
One plus two plus six is nine.
Five plus seven is twelve.
Carry the one.
One plus six is seven.
Okay, so now here 's where the decimals come into play.
And your I think you 're going to be shocked by how straightforward this is.
What I do is I go back to the original problem
and now I actually pay attention to the decimals.
And I say, how many total numbers are behind the decimal point?
Well, there 's one number behind the decimal point,
two numbers behind the decimal point,
three numbers behind the decimal point,
four numbers behind the decimal point.
One, two, three, four.
So there are four numbers behind the decimal point in the problem I did, and I just count here.
One, two, three, four.
The answer will also have four numbers behind the decimal point,
and that 's the answer.
Seventy - two point nine two four six.
Now let me ask you a question.
If I had a zero here,
would that count as an extra number behind the decimal point?
Well, it only would have been
if you actually used the zero in the multiplication.
Maybe that confuses you.
What I would recommend,
if you have any trailing zeros with a decimal like this,
you should actually just ignore those zeros,
and then do the problem just the way I did it.
And remember, that 's only for trailing zeros.
If this was the bottom number then that zero would matter
because it 's not a trailing zero, its actually part of the number.
Let 's do a couple more examples and I think that' ll make sense.
So let 's say I had five - -
and I 'm going to do a simpler example arithmetically.
I think it 'll help you with some principles.
If I said five point one zero times one point zero nine.
So there 's two things we could do.
We could just multiply it the way it is.
Actually let 's do it both ways.
And I 'll show you that you get the same answer whether or not you ignore that zero.
So in the first case let 's not ignore the zero.
Let 's use that zero, even though that trailing zero in the decimal - -
five point one zero is the same thing as five point one.
But let 's use it.
Nine times zero is zero.
Nine times one is nine.
Nine times five is forty - five.
And in the zeros place you put a zero
and then zero times everything is zero. Right?
Zero times zero, zero times one, zero times five.
Put two zeros here.
And then one times zero is zero.
One times one is one.
And one times five is five.
And now we add it all.
We get zero, nine, five, five, five.
And like we did before, we just count the decimals.
One, two, three, four.
So one, two, three, four.
So the decimal will go here.
So we got five point five five nine zero as the answer.
Now what if we did like I was recommending, we actually ignored the zero?
So I say, And I can actually rewrite it as one point zero nine times five point one.
Because you know in multiplication order doesn 't matter.
a times b is the same thing as b times a.
Two times three is the same thing as three times two.
So one point zero nine times five point one is the same thing as five point one times one point zero nine.
So let 's just multiply this out.
And notice, these are the same numbers.
All I did is I took the zero off.
So, first I just ignore the decimals. I say one times nine is nine.
One times zero is zero.
One times one is one.
Put a zero here.
Five times nine is forty - five.
Carry the four.
Five time zero is zero.
Plus four is four.
Five times one is five.
Now I add.
Nine, five, five, five.
Now I 'm at the point
that I can actually pay attention to the decimal points.
How many numbers are behind the decimals?
Well, there 's one, two, three.
So I go one, two, three, and put the decimal point right here.
Notice I got the same exact answer.
The only difference is that this one had a trailing zero,
which really doesn 't make a number any different.
I could add a hundred zeros here
and the number 's really not a different number.
If you were a computer programmer
or a statistician of some kind, this could be an important number.
But ignore what I just said.
But for your purposes, these trailing zeros mean nothing.
Same way a leading zero actually would mean nothing.
No one ever does that.
Let me do - - well, let me see how much time I have.
I have two more minutes.
Let me do one more problem just to maybe hit the point home.
You know, this is really no different than level four multiplication.
And at the end you just have to count the numbers behind the decimal point.
So five times five is twenty - five.
Whoops. Twenty - five.
I 'm already getting messy.
Carry the two.
Fve times seven is thirty - five.
Plus two is thirty - seven.
Bring down the seven, carry the three.
Five times zero is zero.
Plus three.
So it 's three hundred and seventy - five, ignore that blob.
I 'm sorry for being so messy.
And then you put a zero.
One times five is five.
One times seven is seven.
Ignore that.
Now we add.
We say five plus zero is five.
Seven plus five is twelve.
One plus three plus seven is eleven.
So we got our answer,
now we just have to count the decimals.
So here we have one, two, three, four,
five numbers behind the decimal point.
But in our answer we only have four digits,
so how can we get five numbers behind the decimal point?
Well, we start here.
We say one, two, three, four,
and we need one more number behind the decimal point,
so we add a zero here.
And then we put the decimal point.
See what I just did?
We had to have five numbers behind the decimal point.
And we only had four numbers in the answer.
So I added a leading zero and then put the decimal point.
And now we have five numbers behind the decimal point.
And I 've shown you a very mechanical way of doing this.
Hopefully in the future I can give you a seminar on actually
why this method of counting the numbers behind the decimal points actually works.
But I think you are ready to try some problems on multiplying decimals.
Have fun!

In the web, over the last five or 10 years, we 've kind of established a new type of partner
and those are traffic partners
In a traffic partner, we have long - term agreements with other companies
that deliver predictable levels of customers to our website.
How do we do that?
Well, these are sometimes cross referral or swapping deals.
We pay another company may be on a per - referral basis
and our partners, our traffic partners, drive traffic using text links, on - site promotions
and ads on their site and sometimes, we might even exchange email list
and other data with these partners.
So, if you 're on the web, traffic partner is a virtual channel partner
that simply doesn 't exist in the physical world.

Given what we have build up so far, we can actually use the pieces to build a heap from scratch.
We have the heap structure.
In this case, with seven nodes and we filled them in with this random two digit numbers
and it 's not heap at the moment, but we can make the heap property be satisfied
and this the way we 're going to do it.
We 're going to start of at the root, which is node zero and we' re going to say,
okay, well, to make this into a heap, well first magically make this into a heap
and make this into a heap and once we 're done
then we could do down heapify on this value and everything will be fine.
Alright. How do we build a heap out of this smaller piece? Well, we can do it again recursively.
We can say to build a heap, rooted at this node, make this new heap,
make this new heap and then down heapify.
Well, how do we do this guys? Well the single two nodes are already heaps.
Any leaf, anything that is a leaf already were done. That 's our termination condition.
This is a heap. We 'll check them off as we go. This is a heap. This is a heap. This is a heap.
Alright so, now to make this whole thing a heap, we need to do our little swap thing.
So 88 gets swap, this is down heapify 88 gets swap with 30
because 30 is the smaller of the children
and now that down heapify is completed this whole thing is a heap.
We need to do this subtree, again same trick. This guys are already heaps.
To make this into a heap, we have to swap it with the smaller of the children 13.
Now down heapify finish so this is a heap and now we 've just got the last little step
to make the whole structure here into a heap, we need to do down heapify on the root node.
Which means swapping it with the smallest of the children that 's the 13 and continuing recursively
because that 's what down heapify does, swapping it with the smallest
until we reach the bottom and that 's done.
The whole thing is a heap. We made a heap. Woohoo! Perhaps even cooler.
The running time is quite nice. The time it takes to build a heap out of an elements.
Well, we build two heaps of size n / 2 then there 's a log in step to down heapify
and this is a slightly hard piece to analyze.
It 's not so hard to figure out that we' re essentially running down heapify
which is a log in operation on each of the node sort as a root.
We know that it 's actually big O (n log n)
and there 's a tighter analysis, which I' m not going to give that actually shows that this T (n) is Θ (n).
We could actually establish the heap property through out the tree on n nodes
in the near time, that 's pretty cool.

The first word we want to think about
is something called Total Available Market,
and I like to think of Total Available Market as a pie.
It 's the entire pie.
Total Available Market says, look,
how many people or companies or whatever your unit of sale is
would want or need this product,
and how large is the market
in dollars or units
if they all bought?
That 's just a pretty nice calculation.
And the question is, okay,
how would I find out?
In different industries, there are analysts that
specialize in vertical markets and enterprise software,
it 's Gartner and Forrester; in video games,
it 's the MPD Group; in consumer research,
it 's Nielsen; if you want to understand
how many mobile startups there are,
you go to the Mobile Startup Genome Project, et cetera.
So you need to ask some questions as
which industry analysts kind of follow your specific domain,
and then also Wall Street analysts follow competitors in this business.
That is, they follow whoever 's public;
in fact, some of them write very nice research reports.
If you have access to university library or a friendly broker,
you can get a great free industry analyst report
and I would be asking others, as well,
and Google is your best friend here.
I truly would be spending time trying to understand,
is this a $1 billion market,
and by the way, if you throw out those numbers,
the first thing I 'm going to ask you is,
well, that 's nice, but break it down for me.
Help me understand how many users,
who are the players, what are the competitors, et cetera.
You need to understand this total available market pie
in some detail before I 'll let you get to the next step,
and the next step is
how big is my slice?
And we tend to use a fancy word for that:
What 's the served available market?
The served available market means
okay, well instead of the theory that there are 7 billion people in the world,
how many people really can use a mobile app?
Oh, well a mobile app is kind of dependent on
how many people have mobile Smart Phones,
and if I 'm making the mobile app for, let' s say an Android platform,
then the first question is
how many theoretical people are going to be using
Android platforms in this year and in the next 5?
Oh, now I can start estimating
what 's my served available market.
And so many people have the money to buy the product;
that is, are you a 99 - cent product
or are you a $99 product?
Now you 're narrowing the market based on pricing or availability
and you want to do some thought experiments like
how large would the market be in dollars
if they all bought - -
if everyone in the served available market bought,
how large would this be,
and this is kind of your first test
to say, "Oh" or "Wow."
So you want to understand this before dollars and units.
How do you find out?
Well, this is one where you 're really out of the building and talking to customers.
Then I think of this again using the pie analogy
the first step was
try to understand the number of people in the world,
but now we can narrow it down if I have the Android app
to number of Android phones - - capable phones,
and then down to how many would buy it at my price,
but now we really want to get pretty specific.
Who example am I going to sell in years 1, 2, and 3?
How many customers is that?
How large is the market if they all bought?
That is, what we now are coming up with
is the total number of dollars
if you had 100% market share,
your revenue isn 't going to exceed this number,
and many units would that be?
Again, how do I find out?
Boy, this is really about
getting out of the building and talking to customers
and talking to potential channel partners,
and talking to competitors, et cetera.
You really, at the end of this exercise,
now have the first pass hypothesis
about is this business model canvas
worth executing for the next couple of years?

What we now know is most startups fail from a lack of customers
than from a failure of product development and that 's really interesting even in Silicon Valley
where we would probably take more technical risk
per square inch or square foot than anywhere else in the world.
We go out of business typically not because we didn 't deliver a product.
We go out of business, because we didn 't find enough customers to pay us enough money.
That 's a big idea, because if you think about it, we have all these processes
to manage the engineering process, why?
Because that is the biggest risk in a large company,
but we had no processes to manage the customer risk.
In fact, the best we could do, in the old days, is hire a VP of sales who told you
"Oh, I have a great Rolodex, great set of contacts."
But we really have no formal process for searching for what customers needs are,
and in fact, we 've just come up with one and that' s going to be a key part of this course.
This search for the business model.
This search for the truth is called customer development,
and customer development really has two pieces, the search and its execution,
And in this class, we 're going to be talking about the first two steps, customer discovery,
customer validation, the pivots that connect them, and then a few that are lucky.
We actually get to execute your business model in customer creation and company building.
The other piece that goes with the process in a startup
is now in a customer development process but in agile engineering process.
One example is extreme programing or XP, which basically
is built around this idea of iteration and incremental delivery of the product.
This is a big idea; it says instead of building every possible feature on day one,
we 're actually going to incrementally and iteratively interact with customers,
test each portion of the product, and see if what we 're building
actually has a home outside the building.
So what this really means is that for process instead of just going to execution first,
hiring product managers, doing waterfall development, or maybe even agile nowadays,
we 're actually going to start with a customer development process
coupled with some kind of agile engineering process.
Which one you pick? How to use XP as an example?
But it could be whatever your favorite process is, and by the way,
don 't only think that agile engineering and agile development is about software.
Toyota and the Toyota production system actually have it for a hardware of decade before anybody
in software who ever thought about it.
So you could be building products anything from microprocessors to medical equipment
to hardware, software, etc. using an iterative and incremental engineering process.
And again, once you 're done with that, of course, you want to manage this in a formal process,
but not before you do the plan.

So lets take a look at our Jersey Square team as
an example and see how they came up with their
value proposition. Now, whats interesting is if
you remember value proposition describes not
only the features but also the pains and gains
that they see, that theyve actually craved for the
customer and that the goal is to figure out what
the MVP is.
And if we see the Jersey Square team,
they actually did a pretty good job talking
about pains and gains, a cheaper way to wear
officially licensed sports jerseys to a game,
to eliminate the risk of owning a players jersey
who is going to be traded, or to provide an
alternative to purchasing counterfeit jerseys.
Pretty good for pains and gains.
But what they forgot to describe is what are the
features and just so we could remember the
features for Jersey Square is they were going to
provide a single place where you could rent sports
jerseys, so you wouldnt have to own them and
maintain them to visit your favorite team.
And what they also missed is what was the
MVP or minimum viable product of what they
were going to build. And in their case it was
going to be a website with rental and a stock of
jerseys of the most popular teams at first in the
New York area and then nationally in the United
States and then ultimately internationally.
So those were kind of missing, but again
starting with pains and gains was pretty
good for their value proposition.
Notice by the way, while they were working on
value proposition, they also had some
hypothesis about the customer segments.
And this is a key idea, value proposition and
customer segments are the first two things you
tend to work on with the business model canvas.
Because these two have a special name called
product market fit. And product market fit just
simply says what is the match between what you
are building and what customers need and
want, and who are those customers.
So, while the goal in value prop is to figure out
the MVP, yes, well see later the goal in
customer segments is to figure out who and
what the archetype of the customer is. So again
you could start either with customer segments or
you could start with a product and value prop
itself, it really doesnt matter. But in most teams
if they are technology driven, they tend to start
on value prop and most teams if they happen to
be marketers or business people, happen to start
with the customer segments. There is no right
place, but its the interaction between these two.

Andrew Goldberg described a data structure that can be used
to very rapidly compute shortest - path distances between nodes in a network.
The way that it worked was each node of the network has a label.
What a label is is a list of other nodes in a network that he called hubs
along with the distance to that hub.
The hubs are chosen for each node,
the labels are chosen for each node,
so that they have the property that for any two nodes in the network,
any two nodes where you want to compute a shortest - path length between them,
will have some hub in common in their labels that is on the shortest path
between those nodes.
Let 's make sure that you have a feel for this idea,
and let 's look at a particular kind of network - - a star network - -
where there is one node in the middle and all these other nodes directly connected to it.
How many hubs do we need to list in the labels of each of the nodes in a star network
so that we can make sure that we satisfy this property
that we can compute the shortest path length sufficiently,
specifically because for any pair of nodes in the network
their labels will have some hub in common.
Why don 't you type the number into the box.
You can use this particular star network as your example
and give the answer for this star network,
but it turns out it actually works for star networks of any size.

All right so to compute this quantity, what we need to do is first take a look at the neighbors of ORD.
In this case, we 've got Seattle, Los Angeles, Dallas Forth Worth, not Atlanta but Pittsburgh.
So Kv which is the number of neighbors is 4.
And then we have to count up the number of edges between these neighbor cities.
So in this particular case we 've got one edge between Seattle and Los Angeles.
One between Los Angeles and Dallas and that 's it.
Pittsburgh doesn 't have any edges that connect to any other pink nodes. So that makes this value 2.
Now we need to apply the formula for the clustering coefficient
to see what value we get from this case.
And the formula says it 's 2 times the number of links.
Divided by the degree times 1 minus the degree. So in this case we get 1 / 3.

Let 's prove with the derivative of e to the x' s, and I think
that this is one of the most amazing things, depending on
how you view it about either calculus or math
or the universe.
before that the derivative of e to the x is equal to e to
the x, which is amazing.
The slope at any point of that line is equal to the x value - -
is equal to the function at that point, not the x value.
The slope at any point is equal to e.
That is mind boggling.
And that also means that the second derivative at any point
is equal to the function of that value or the third
derivative, or the infinite derivative, and that never
But anyway back to work.
So how are we going to prove this?
Well we already proved - - I actually just did it right
before starting this video - - that the derivative - - and some
people actually call this the definition of e.
They go the other way around.
They say there is some number for which this is true,
and we call that number e.
So it could almost be viewed as a little bit circular, but be
we said that e is equal to the limit as n approaches infinity
of 1 over 1 plus n to the end.
And then using this we actually proved that derivative of
ln of x is equal to 1 / x.
The derivative of log base e of x is equal to 1 / x.
Let me keep switching colors to keep it interesting.
This is almost trivial.
This is equal to the logarithm of a to the b is equal to b
times the logarithm of a, so this is equal to the
derivative of x ln of e.
And this is just saying e to what power is equal to e.
Well, to the first power, right?
So this just equals the derivative of x, which we
have shown as equal to 1.
I think we have shown it, hopefully we 've shown it.
If we haven 't, that' s actually a very easy one to prove.
OK fair enough.
We did that.
But let 's do this another way.
Let 's use the chain rule.
So what doe the chain rule say?
If we have f of g of x, where we have one function embedded
in another one, the chain rule say we take the derivative of
the inside function, so d / dx of e to the x.
And then we take the derivative of the outside function or the
derivative of the outside function with respect
to the inner function.
You can almost view it that way.
So the derivative ln of e to the x with
respect to e to the x.
I know that 's a little confusing.
You could have written a d e to the x down over here, but I
think you know the chain rule by now.
That is equal to 1 over e to the x.
And that just comes from this.
But instead of an x, we have e to the x.
So this is just a chain rule.
Well what else do we know?
We know that this is equal to this, and we also know that
this is equal to this.
So this must be equal to this.
So this must be equal to 1.
Well let 's just multiply both sides of this
equation by e to the x.
We get on the left hand side, we 're just left
with this expression.
The derivative of e to the x times - we 're multiplying both
sides by e to the x, times e to the x over e to the x.
I just chose to put the e to the x on this term,
is equal to e to the x.
This is 1.
Scratch it out.
We 're done.
That might not have been completely satisfying
for you, but it works.
The derivative of e to the x is equal to e to the x.
holiday or something, and people should just
ponder this, because it really is fascinating.
But then actually this will lead us to I would say even
more dramatic results in the not too far off future.

Let 's take a look at our Jersey Square team
and because they understand their archetype
is interested in both subscription and rental,
let 's see what they were thinking.
And they said well, let 's see one
particular model could be an annual subscription,
which is a strategy and here is the tactic
at a $199 per year and we could give them
authentic top of line jerseys and free shipping
and send a jersey back and exchange for another.
We could offer them either a yearly price
or we could offer a monthly price which
would cost more but wouldn 't commit them
for such a longer period of time
but they would get the exact same features.
They discovered there was another archetype,
another customer segment that was casual users.
And these people just wanted a one - time
use for a one - week rental for a particular game.
Well you get a top of line jersey and you get
shipping but the goal was you send the jersey
back within one week and we won 't charge you
for the jersey and that 's a rental.
So they had three pricing models, they were
now going to a / b test for price elasticity.

All right, to introduce this concept,
it 's going to help to have another definition that I haven' t given you yet.
So here 's a graph, we have been talking about things like shortest paths.
So let 's look at a path from a to g. So here' s a natural path to choose.
It 's one of the shortest paths from a to g, but it' s by no means the only path from a to g.
So here 's another path from a to g. a to b to e to d to a to b to e to g. It' s a path.
It 's going from node to node crossing edges but it' s not a simple path.
So simple path is not allowed to have any repeated nodes.
Any shortest path is going to be a simple path. Right. Why?
Because if we had any repeats along the way from a to g,
if we visit b and then sometime later we go back to b then there 's going to be a path
that just goes from a to b and then using this path from b to g.
We don 't need any of these links in between.
So if the shortest path actually had on it a repeat, it was not simple path,
then it can 't be a shortest path, there must be a shorter path still, so that' s a contradiction.
Now the longest simple path that you can have, can have it most
n nodes on it because there is only n nodes in the graph and we 're not allowed to repeat any.
So the longest simple path is at link n. This graph has seven nodes.
So let 's ask the question having to do with this graph here.
I want you to check each box with number K next to it
if there 's a simple path of K nodes that goes from a to g.
So for example, it can 't be one beacause it has to have at least a and g on it,
and we already solved path a, b, e, g
that 's a simple path that has four nodes on it, so I' ll give you four.
For each possible length, check the box if there is a simple path
with that number of nodes on it from a to g.

Write the prime factorization of 75.
Write your answer using exponential notation.
So we have a couple of interesting things here.
Prime factorization, and they say exponential notation.
We 'll worry about the exponential notation later.
So the first thing we have to worry about is what is even a
prime number?
And just as a refresher, a prime number is a number
that 's only divisible by itself and one, so examples of
prime numbers - - let me write some numbers down.
Prime, not prime. Not prime.
So 2 is a prime number.
It 's only divisible by 1 and 2.
3 is another prime number.
Now, 4 is not prime, because this is
divisible by 1, 2 and 4.
We could keep going.
5, well, 5 is only divisible by 1 and 5, so 5 is prime.
6 is not prime, because it 's divisible by 2 and 3.
I think you get the general idea.
You move to 7, 7 is prime.
It 's only divisible by 1 and 7.
8 is not prime.
9 you might be tempted to say is prime, but remember, it 's
also divisible by 3, so 9 is not prime.
Prime is not the same thing as odd numbers.
Then if you move to 10, 10 is also not prime,
divisible by 2 and 5.
11, it 's only divisible by 1 and 11, so 11 is
then a prime number.
And we could keep going on like this.
People have written computer programs looking for the
highest prime and all of that.
So now that we know what a prime is, a prime
factorization is breaking up a number, like 75, into a
product of prime numbers.
So let 's try to do that.
So we 're going to start with 75, and I' m going to do it
using what we call a factorization tree.
So we first try to find just the smallest prime number that
will go into 75.
Now, the smallest prime number is 2.
Does 2 go into 75?
Well, 75 is an odd number, or the number in the ones place,
this 5, is an odd number.
5 is not divisible by 2, so 2 will not go into 75.
So then we could try 3.
Does 3 go into 75?
Well, 7 plus 5 is 12.
12 is divisible by 3, so 3 will go into it.
So 75 is 3 times something else.
And if you 've ever dealt with change, you know that if you
have three quarters, you have 75 cents, or if you have 3
times 25, you have 75.
So this is 3 times 25.
And you can multiply this out if you don 't believe me.
Multiple out 3 times 25.
Now, is 25 divisible by - - you can give up on 2.
If 75 wasn 't divisible by 2, 25' s not going to be divisible
by 2 either.
But maybe 25 is divisible by 3 again.
So if you take the digits 2 plus 5, you get 7.
7 is not divisible by 3, so 25 will not be divisible by 3.
So we keep moving up: 5.
Is 25 divisible by 5?
Well, sure.
It 's 5 times 5.
So 25 is 5 times 5.
And we 're done with our prime factorization because now we
have all prime numbers here.
So we can write that 75 is 3 times 5 times 5.
So 75 is equal to 3 times 5 times 5.
We can say it 's 3 times 25.
25 is 5 times 5.
3 times 25, 25 is 5 times 5.
So this is a prime factorization, but they want
us to write our answer using exponential notation.
So that just means, if we have repeated primes, we can write
those as an exponent.
So what is 5 times 5?
5 times 5 is 5 multiplied by itself two times.
This is the same thing as 5 to the second power.
So if we want to write our answer using exponential
notation, we could say this is equal to 3 times 5 to the
second power, which is the same thing as 5 times 5.

All right - - so why is that - - so it turns out that this little plastic ring thing, you can think of it as a graph
where each of the little plastic connectors is actually an edge between nodes
and the place that they intersect is a node.
We 've got a node here and a node here - - they' re connected.
Node here and node here - - they 're connected, connected. This is a node and they' re connected.
Mark all the intersection points as nodes and put all the pieces of plastic in that connect them as edges.
You can now just focus on that graph. So here 's our graph.
It has a total of 26 nodes and 39 edges and what we 're looking for in this graph - -
we 're going cut edges, we' re going to remove edges to make a tree.
Right - - the tree is going to be connected and have no turtle catchers
which we in graph theory call cycles.
How many edges are in a tree where 26 nodes, 25. How many do we have - - 39.
Well, we 're going to have to kill 14 edges to turn this into a tree.
I first discovered this trick quite by accident that I actually was cutting up the little ring things
that saved the turtles and a surprise, that no matter how I did, I always seem to
to come out with the same number and then I realize it was just a graph theory problem.

Welcome to the second presentation on functions.
So let 's take off where we left off before.
I still apologize - - in retrospect that that
whole Sal food example.
Well maybe it was helpful, so I 'm going to leave it there.
Let 's do some more problems.
I think the best thing is to keep doing problems with you
and I think you 'll see the example, and hopefully
you 'll actually see that functions are kind of fun.
Let 's do some more problems.
Let 's start off with an example, not too different
than what we saw before.
Let 's say that g of x is equal to 1 if x is even, and
it equals 0 if x is odd.
And let 's say f of x is equal to x plus 3 times g of x.
And let 's say - - I' m going to make it really complicated - -
well, actually I 'm not going to make it any more
complicated now.
So let 's try some problems.
So let 's give an example.
What is f of 5.
Well, it 's really pretty straightforward.
We take this 5 and we replace it for x in the function f.
So f of 5 is equal to 5 plus 3 times g of 5, right?
We just literally took this 5 and replace it everywhere
where we see an x.
If instead of a 5, I had like a dog here, it would be f of dog
would equal dog plus 3 times g of dog.
Not that that would necessarily make any sense, but
you get the idea.
So f of 5 equals 5 plus 3 times g of 5.
But what does that equal?
So the 5 stays the same, plus 3 times - - well what 's g of 5?
Well, if we put 5 here, if 5 is even we do 1,
if five is odd we do 0.
Well 5 is odd so it 's a 0.
So g of 5 is equal to 0.
So this is 3 times 0.
So this equals just 5, right, because 3 times
0 is equal to 5.
Well what would be f of 6?
Well, f of 6 would equal 6 plus 3 times g of 6.
And once again, that equals 6 plus - - well, this time g of
6 is, well, 6 is even, so 1.
So g of 6 is equal to 1.
So this equals 6 plus 3 times 1.
So this equals 6 plus 3 which equals 9.
I think you might be getting the idea now.
At first when you see a problem with a lot of these functions,
it seems very confusing.
But if you just keep taking what 's inside of the
parentheses and replacing that for x and just keep moving
along that way, you make a lot of progress on these problems.
Let 's try a harder one.
Let 's say I said that f of x is equal to x squared plus 1.
Let 's say that g of x is equal to 2x plus f of x minus 3.
And h of x is equal to 5x.
Now I 'm going to give you a tough problem.
What is h of g of x?
No.
What is h of g of - - let 's pick a number - - let' s say 3?
h of g of 3.
Actually, we 'll do examples in the future where we actually
could leave the x there and we 'll solve for it.
But let 's say this particular example, what is h of g of 3?
At first you might say wow, this is crazy, Sal, I don 't
know how to even start here.
But you just take it step - by - step.
What can we figure out?
Can we figure out what g of 3 is?
Well sure.
We could take the 3 and put it into the function g and
see what it spits out.
So let 's work on g of 3 first.
So, g of 3 equals - - well it 's 2 times 3, right, we' re just
replacing wherever we see an x with a 3.
So it 's 2 times 3, so that' s 6, plus f of - - what, we 'll
just replace the x again.
3 minus 3, right?
So this g of 3 is equal to 6 plus f of what?
3 minus 3 is 0.
Now we have to figure out f of 0 is.
We have a definition here for f, so we just figure it out.
f of 0 is equal to - - well, you replace the 0 here.
So you get 0 squared, which is 0 plus 1.
So it 's f of 0 is 1.
So you take that and you replace it for f of 0.
So you get g of 3 is equal to 6 plus 1.
So g of 3 is equal to 7, right?
Now we know what g of 3 is equal to.
We can substitute that back here.
So that 's the same thing - - we know g of 3 is equal to 7,
so that 's the same thing as h of 7.
And h of 7 is just equal to 5 times 7 equals 35.
So I think you 're probably a little confused here, and I
would have been if I was in your shoes.
But the important thing is when you first see this problem
you 're like what can I tackle first?
h of g of 3, it seems very confusing.
Well, g of 3, can I tackle that?
Sure.
I have a definition of what the function g does when
it 's given an x, or in this case, was given a 3.
And that 's what we did.
We figured out what g of 3 was first.
And g of 3, we just substituted the 3, and we said well that 's
6 plus f of 3 minus 3, right?
Because we just replaced that x with that 3.
And we just kept solving.
We figured out what f of 0 is up here.
And we got g of 3 equals 7.
Then we substituted that back in right here.
We got h of 7 is equal to 35 because it was 5 times 7.
Let 's do some more problems.
Actually, let 's do another example with the same
set of functions.
I don 't want to keep confusing you with new functions.
Let me it erase this as fast as I can.
I think I 'm getting faster at this erasing business.
You can sit and think a little bit about what we just
did while I erase.
So let 's do another problem.
What is f of h of 10?
Well, first we want to figure out what h of 10 is, right?
Well, we could do it in a different way
as we 'll see later.
But we can figure out what h of 10 is pretty easily.
We take the 10, substitute it in for x.
h of 10 is equal to 5 times x.
In this case x is 10 so it equals 50.
So we know h of 10 equals 50.
So we know h of 10 equals 50, so we substitute
that back in here.
So we say f of h of 10 is the same thing as f of 50.
And then f of 50 is, I think pretty straightforward
at this point.
You just take that 50 and replace it back here.
Well, it 's 50 squared plus 1.
Well, 50 squared is 2, 500 plus 1.
That equals 2, 501.
What is g of h of 1?
Well, we take h of 1, h of 1 is 5, so this is equal to g of 5.
And g of 5, we just replace the 5 here, so g of 5 is equal to 2
times 5 plus f of 5 minus 3.
We just take wherever we saw an x and replace it with a 5.
Well, that 's equal to 2 times 5 is 10, plus f of 5 minus 3.
Well 5 minus 3 is 2.
Plus f of 2.
What 's f of 2?
Well, 2 squared plus 1 is 5, right? f of 2 is 5
- - 2 squared plus 1.
So that equals 10 plus 5 which equals 15.
If you 're still confused, don' t worry.
I 'm about to record some more problems that will give you
even more examples of function problems.
See you in the next presentation.
Bye.


We need to divide 0. 25 into 1. 03075.
Now the first thing you want to do when your divisor, the
number that you 're dividing into the other number, is a
decimal, is to multiply it by 10 enough times so that it
becomes a whole number so you can shift the
decimal to the right.
So every time you multiply something by 10, you 're
shifting the decimal over to the right once.
So in this case, we want to switch it over the
right once and twice.
So 0. 25 times 10 twice is the same thing as 0. 25 times 100,
and we 'll turn the 0. 25 into 25.
Now if you do that with the divisor, you also have to do
that with the dividend, the number that
you 're dividing into.
So we also have to multiply this by 10 twice, or another
way of doing it is shift the decimal over
to the right twice.
So we shift it over once, twice.
It will sit right over here.
And to see why that makes sense, you just have to
realize that this expression right here, this division
problem, is the exact same thing as having 1. 03075
divided by 0. 25.
And so we 're multiplying the 0. 25 by 10 twice.
We 're essentially multiplying it by 100.
Let me do that in a different color.
We 're multiplying it by 100 in the denominator.
This is the divisor.
We 're multiplying it by 100, so we also have to do the same
thing to the numerator, if we don 't want to change this
expression, if we don 't want to change the number.
So we also have to multiply that by 100.
And when you do that, this becomes 25, and
this becomes 103. 075.
Now let me just rewrite this.
Sometimes if you 're doing this in a workbook or something,
you don 't have to rewrite it as long as you remember where
the decimal is.
But I 'm going to rewrite it, just so it' s
a little bit neater.
So we multiplied both the divisor and
the dividend by 100.
This problem becomes 25 divided into 103. 075.
These are going to result in the exact same quotient.
They 're the exact same fraction, if you want to view
it that way.
We 've just multiplied both the numerator and the denominator
by 100 to shift the decimal over to the right twice.
Now that we 've done that, we' re ready to divide.
So the first thing, we have 25 here, and there 's always a
little bit of an art to dividing something by a
multiple - digit number, so we 'll see how well we can do.
So 25 does not go into 1.
25 does not go into 10.
25 does go into 103.
We know that 4 times 25 is 100, so 25 goes
into 100 four times.
4 times 5 is 20.
4 times 2 is 8, plus 2 is 100.
We knew that.
Four quarters is $1. 00.
It 's 100 cents.
And now we subtract.
103 minus 100 is going to be 3, and now we can
bring down this 0.
So we bring down that 0 there.
25 goes into 30 one time.
And if we want, we could immediately put
this decimal here.
We don 't have to wait until the end of the problem.
This decimal sits right in that place, so we could always
have that decimal sitting right there in our quotient or
in our answer.

So we were at 25 goes into 30 one time.
1 times 25 is 25, and then we can subtract.
30 minus 25, well, that 's just 5.
I mean, we can do all this borrowing business, or
regrouping.
This can become a 10.
This becomes a 2.
10 minus 5 is 5.
2 minus 2 is nothing.
But anyway, 30 minus 25 is 5.
Now we can bring down this 7.
25 goes into 57 two times, right?
25 times 2 is 50.
25 goes into 57 two times.
2 times 25 is 50.
And now we subtract again.
57 minus 50 is 7.
And now we 're almost done.

We bring down that 5 right over there.
25 goes into 75 three times.
3 times 25 is 75.
3 times 5 is 15.
Regroup the 1.
We can ignore that.
That was from before.
3 times 2 is 6, plus 1 is 7.
So you can see that.
And then we subtract, and then we have no remainder.
So 25 goes into 103. 075 exactly 4. 123 times, which
makes sense, because 25 goes into 100 about four times.
This is a little bit larger than 100, so it 's going to be
a little bit more than four times.
And that 's going to be the exact same answer as the
number of times that 0. 25 goes into 1. 03075.
This will also be 4. 123.
So this fraction, or this expression, is the exact same
thing as 4. 123.
And we 're done!

Welcome to the presentation on derivatives.
I think you 're going to find that this is when math starts
to become a lot more fun than it was just a few topics ago.
Well let 's get started with our derivatives.
I know it sounds very complicated.
Well, in general, if I have a straight line - - let me see if I
can draw a straight line properly - - if I had a straight
line - - that 's my coordinate axes, which aren' t straight - -
this is a straight line.
find the slope - - I think you already know how to do this - -
it 's just the change in y divided by the change in x.
If I wanted to find the slope - - really I mean the slope is the
same, because it is a straight line, the slope is the same
across the whole line, but if I want to find the slope at any
point in this line, what I would do is I would pick a
point x - - say I 'd pick this point.
We 'd pick a different color - - I' d take this point, I 'd pick
this point - - it 's pretty arbitrary, I could pick any two
points, and I would figure out what the change in y is - - this
is the change in y, delta y, that 's just another way of
saying change in y - - and this is the change in x.
delta x.
And we figured out that the slope is defined really as
And another way of saying that is delta - - it 's that triangle - -
delta y divided by delta x.
Now what happens, though, if we 're not dealing
with a straight line?
Let me see if I have space to draw that.
Another coordinate axes.
Now let 's say, instead of just a regular line like this, this
follows the standard y equals mx plus b.
Let 's just say I had the curve y equals x squared.
Let me draw it in a different color.
So y equals x squared looks something like this.
It 's a curve, you' re probably pretty familiar with it by now.
And what I 'm going to ask you is, what is the
slope of this curve?
And think about that.
What does it mean to take the slope of a curve now?
Well, in this line, the slope was the same throughout
the whole line.
But if you look at this curve, doesn 't the
slope change, right?
Here it 's almost flat, and it gets steeper steeper steeper
steeper steeper until gets pretty steep.
And if you go really far out, it gets extremely steep.
So you 're probably saying, well, how do you figure out
the slope of a curve whose slope keeps changing?
Well there is no slope for the entire curve.
For a line, there is a slope for the entire line, because
the slope never changes.
But what we could try to do is figure out what the
slope is at a given point.
And the slope at a given point would be the same as the
slope of a tangent line.
For example - - let me pick a green - - the slope at this point
right here would be the same as the slope of this line.
Right?
Because this line is tangent to it.
So it just touches that curve, and at that exact point, they
would have - - this blue curve, y equals x squared, would have
the same slope as this green line.
But if we go to a point back here, even though this is a
really badly drawn graph, the slope would be
something like this.
The tangent slope.
The slope would be a negative slope, and here it 's a positive
slope, but if we took a point here, the slope would
be even more positive.
So how are we going to figure this out?
How are we going to figure out what the slope is at any point
along the curve y equals x squared?
That 's where the derivative comes into use, and now for the
first time you 'll actually see why a limit is actually
a useful concept.
So let me try to redraw the curve.
OK, I 'll draw my axes, that' s the y - axis - - I 'll just do it in
the first quadrant - - and this is - - I really have to find a
better tool to do my - - this is x coordinate, and then let
So y equals x squared looks something like this.
I 'm really concentrating to draw this at
least decently good.
Let 's call this point a.
At this point, x equals a.
And of course this is f of a.
the slope of a secant line.
A line between - - we take another point, say, somewhat
close, to this point on the graph, let 's say here, and if
we could figure out the slope of this line, it would be a
bit of an approximation of the slope of the curve
exactly at this point.
Secant line looks something like that.
And let 's say that this point right here is a plus h, where
this distance is just h, this is a plus h, we 're just going
h away from a, and then this point right here
My pen is malfunctioning.
slope is at this point.
And the closer that h gets, the closer this point gets to
this point, the better our approximation is going to be,
all the way to the point that if we could actually get the
slope where h equals 0, that would actually be the slope,
the instantaneous slope, at that point in the curve.
So right now, we 're saying that the slope between these two
points, it would be the change in y, so what 's
the change in y?
It 's this, so that this point right here is - - the x
coordinate is - - my thing just keeps messing up - - the x
And this point right here, the coordinate is a and f of a.
So if we just use the standard slope formula, like before, we
would say change in y over change in x.
Well, what 's the change in y?
It 's f of a plus h - - this y coordinate minus this y
coordinate - - minus f of a over the change in x.
Well that change in x is this x coordinate, a plus h, minus
this x coordinate, minus a.
And of course this a and this a cancel out.
So it 's f of a plus h, minus f of a, all over h.
This is just the slope of this secant line.
And if we want to get the slope of the tangent line, we would
just have to find what happens as h gets smaller and
smaller and smaller.
And I think you know where I 'm going.
Really, we just want to, if we want to find the slope of this
tangent line, we just have to find the limit of this
value as h approaches 0.
And then, as h approaches 0, this secant line is going to
get closer and closer to the slope of the tangent line.
And then we 'll know the exact slope at the instantaneous
point along the curve.
And actually, it turns out that this is the definition
of the derivative.
And the derivative is nothing more than the slope of a
curve at an exact point.
And this is super useful, because for the first time,
everything we 've talked about to this point is
the slope of a line.
But now we can take any continuous curve, or most
continuous curves, and find the slope of that curve
at an exact point.
